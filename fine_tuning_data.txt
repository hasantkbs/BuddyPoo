Every year, the evil Protectorate offers a baby to the evil witch in the forest to ensure their villageâs safety. Yet, unknown to them, the witch is Xan, the plump and knowledgeable protector of the babies that she takes to the neighbouring village to be raised as special children, fed on starlight and destined to do wonderful things. Yet, one day, Xan feeds one baby the moon by mistake and fills her with a huge amount of magicÂ â a dangerous amount, as it turns outÂ â so Xan decides to raise Luna as her own. But nothing is straightforward, and when Luna turns 13, everything will change. Kelly Barnhill won the Newbery Medal in the US for this thoughtful and magical book about belonging, fear and family, and itâs easy to see why. The writing flows beautifully and Barnhillâs keen observation of human nature fits naturally into the story, which moves along at a satisfying pace. Xan is a delightfully pleasant and caring crone witch who dispels the traditional image of cackling evildoer, and replaces it with something far more loving and magical. Neil Gaiman, Ursula Le Guin and Diana Wynne Jones.

Oppel also examines Benâs teenage angst over his own personal relationships, and the ethics of animal experimentation in this absorbing novel.

Jennifer Niven's deeply compelling and highly successful first teen novel All The Bright Places was very much for an older audience with its themes of depression and suicide. Her new book Holding Up the Universe is suitable for younger teens as well - and just as powerfully written. The book is narrated in turns by Libby, famous for once being 'America's Fattest Teen' and starting high school after years of being home schooled, and Jack, who seems to be one of the popular kids but secretly suffers from Prospagnosia - the inability to recognise the faces of familiar people even those in this own family which is often called 'face blindness'. Their worlds collide in a horribly cruel high school game and an unlikely friendship is formed that leads to something even deeper. Jennifer Niven is a gorgeous writer. Her characters Libby and Jack feel so real that it's almost impossible to believe they don't live and breathe. The author herself struggled with weight issues and anxiety over the years, particularly as a teenager, so this writing comes from the heart. The spotlight on prosopagnosia sheds an interesting light on a little known but not so uncommon condition. The ultimate message is uplifting and positive and one that teenagers everywhere need to hear: be yourself and you deserve to be wanted and loved for who you are.Â

The comic-strip adventures of Calvin, a naughty boy with a philosophical bent, and his soft toy tiger companion Hobbes, delighted readers from 1985 to 1995. The huge achievement of the comic's creator Bill Watterson is celebrated here in this wonderful cloth-bound three-volume box set, which contains in chronological order every Calvin and Hobbes strip. For those who have never experienced the sheer delight of Watterson's creation, here is a brief summary: Calvin is an active and imaginative little boy; his friend Hobbes appears as a stuffed tiger when other people are around, but when the two of them are alone he comes to life and is Calvin's friend and playmate. They live with Calvin's long-suffering parents, who have to cope with his turbulent behaviour. The charm of the strip is multi-faceted. On the one hand, Calvin is a typical six-year-old with a vivid imagination: one minute he is fearless intergalactic traveller Spaceman Spiff, crash-landing on a hostile planet, the next he is a fearsome T-Rex stalking his victim through the Jurassic jungle. He is in thrall to consumerism, hates school, loves making gruesome snowmen, and plays Calvinball, an anarchic game of ever-changing rules. Yet he is also given to philosophising about the big issues of life, ably supported or gently undermined by Hobbes's quietly caustic asides . Here is an outlet for Watterson's deeply-held views about the craziness of the modern world; indeed, the artist himself has always shunned publicity. The strip is also enhanced by its strong cast of supporting characters. Mrs Wormwood the teacher looms over Calvin when he not paying attention; the school bully is always on hand to 'pound' him; Susie, the little girl from down the road, often gets her own back on her snowball-throwing nemesis. Calvin's dad is a particularly funny creation: long-suffering, anti-media, and a proponent of fresh air, he also manages to get his revenge on his manic son by tying him up in mental knots with spurious bits of information . All these ingredients would, in the right hands, combine to make a perfectly good comic strip, but what always put Calvin and Hobbes ahead of the competition was the sheer artistry of Watterson's illustrations. In this regard, the chronological arrangement of the strips usefully shows Watterson's increasingly sophisticated technique, from his drawings of desert canyons and hideous inhabitants of alien planets, to the facial expressions of all his characters. It is hard to deny that Watterson owes a debt to Charles Schulz, whose Peanuts strip also offered a sophisticated yet deceptively simple evocation of the inner lives of children. For Calvin and Hobbes, however, Watterson combined uncanny ability, more than a touch of surrealism and a huge dose of humour to distil the essence of late-twentieth-century childhood, thereby elevating his strip into a league of its own.

This extraordinary graphic novel is so obviously a labour of love that the reader can only marvel at the energy that has been expended in its creation. Although the two plots that make up the book are essentially simple, the care with which Ware has executed them gives them an almost mythic quality. Jimmy Corrigan is a lonely, single, thirty-something with a boring job in an office cubicle, and a domineering mother who, in spite of living in a nursing home, is never far from the telephone or Jimmy. His crippling shyness renders him incapable of even saying hello to Peggy, the woman who works at an adjacent desk. When the father he has never known sends him an invitation and a plane ticket, Jimmy feels compelled to fly out to meet him. Jimmy's trip is mirrored by the boyhood tale of his grandfather, James, whose relationship with his father is tainted by unhappiness. Young James's mother has died, leaving his father with the unwanted job of bringing up the little boy alone, while at the same time maintaining his job as a glazier at the 1892 Chicago World's Fair. James is a frightened little boy, cowed by his father and bullied at school; he has a vagueness and fragility common to young, lonely and fearful children, qualities that are inherited generations later by his grandson. Chris Ware's illustrations are simply awe-inspiring in the true sense of the word. It is hard to believe that someone could put so much detail into each of the 380 pages that make up this incredible book, but there is a clue to his devotion in the afterword. After spending most of his life avoiding his own father, speaking only rarely on the phone, Ware finally met up with him: 'Gradually, the sublime outrageousness of our evening eroded into two people simply running out of things to say to each other. We weren't father and son anymore, just a pair of regretful men.'

Oppel also examines Benâs teenage angst over his own personal relationships, and the ethics of animal experimentation in this absorbing novel.

Jennifer Niven's deeply compelling and highly successful first teen novel All The Bright Places was very much for an older audience with its themes of depression and suicide. Her new book Holding Up the Universe is suitable for younger teens as well - and just as powerfully written. The book is narrated in turns by Libby, famous for once being 'America's Fattest Teen' and starting high school after years of being home schooled, and Jack, who seems to be one of the popular kids but secretly suffers from Prospagnosia - the inability to recognise the faces of familiar people even those in this own family which is often called 'face blindness'. Their worlds collide in a horribly cruel high school game and an unlikely friendship is formed that leads to something even deeper. Jennifer Niven is a gorgeous writer. Her characters Libby and Jack feel so real that it's almost impossible to believe they don't live and breathe. The author herself struggled with weight issues and anxiety over the years, particularly as a teenager, so this writing comes from the heart. The spotlight on prosopagnosia sheds an interesting light on a little known but not so uncommon condition. The ultimate message is uplifting and positive and one that teenagers everywhere need to hear: be yourself and you deserve to be wanted and loved for who you are.Â

The comic-strip adventures of Calvin, a naughty boy with a philosophical bent, and his soft toy tiger companion Hobbes, delighted readers from 1985 to 1995. The huge achievement of the comic's creator Bill Watterson is celebrated here in this wonderful cloth-bound three-volume box set, which contains in chronological order every Calvin and Hobbes strip. For those who have never experienced the sheer delight of Watterson's creation, here is a brief summary: Calvin is an active and imaginative little boy; his friend Hobbes appears as a stuffed tiger when other people are around, but when the two of them are alone he comes to life and is Calvin's friend and playmate. They live with Calvin's long-suffering parents, who have to cope with his turbulent behaviour. The charm of the strip is multi-faceted. On the one hand, Calvin is a typical six-year-old with a vivid imagination: one minute he is fearless intergalactic traveller Spaceman Spiff, crash-landing on a hostile planet, the next he is a fearsome T-Rex stalking his victim through the Jurassic jungle. He is in thrall to consumerism, hates school, loves making gruesome snowmen, and plays Calvinball, an anarchic game of ever-changing rules. Yet he is also given to philosophising about the big issues of life, ably supported or gently undermined by Hobbes's quietly caustic asides . Here is an outlet for Watterson's deeply-held views about the craziness of the modern world; indeed, the artist himself has always shunned publicity. The strip is also enhanced by its strong cast of supporting characters. Mrs Wormwood the teacher looms over Calvin when he not paying attention; the school bully is always on hand to 'pound' him; Susie, the little girl from down the road, often gets her own back on her snowball-throwing nemesis. Calvin's dad is a particularly funny creation: long-suffering, anti-media, and a proponent of fresh air, he also manages to get his revenge on his manic son by tying him up in mental knots with spurious bits of information . All these ingredients would, in the right hands, combine to make a perfectly good comic strip, but what always put Calvin and Hobbes ahead of the competition was the sheer artistry of Watterson's illustrations. In this regard, the chronological arrangement of the strips usefully shows Watterson's increasingly sophisticated technique, from his drawings of desert canyons and hideous inhabitants of alien planets, to the facial expressions of all his characters. It is hard to deny that Watterson owes a debt to Charles Schulz, whose Peanuts strip also offered a sophisticated yet deceptively simple evocation of the inner lives of children. For Calvin and Hobbes, however, Watterson combined uncanny ability, more than a touch of surrealism and a huge dose of humour to distil the essence of late-twentieth-century childhood, thereby elevating his strip into a league of its own.

This extraordinary graphic novel is so obviously a labour of love that the reader can only marvel at the energy that has been expended in its creation. Although the two plots that make up the book are essentially simple, the care with which Ware has executed them gives them an almost mythic quality. Jimmy Corrigan is a lonely, single, thirty-something with a boring job in an office cubicle, and a domineering mother who, in spite of living in a nursing home, is never far from the telephone or Jimmy. His crippling shyness renders him incapable of even saying hello to Peggy, the woman who works at an adjacent desk. When the father he has never known sends him an invitation and a plane ticket, Jimmy feels compelled to fly out to meet him. Jimmy's trip is mirrored by the boyhood tale of his grandfather, James, whose relationship with his father is tainted by unhappiness. Young James's mother has died, leaving his father with the unwanted job of bringing up the little boy alone, while at the same time maintaining his job as a glazier at the 1892 Chicago World's Fair. James is a frightened little boy, cowed by his father and bullied at school; he has a vagueness and fragility common to young, lonely and fearful children, qualities that are inherited generations later by his grandson. Chris Ware's illustrations are simply awe-inspiring in the true sense of the word. It is hard to believe that someone could put so much detail into each of the 380 pages that make up this incredible book, but there is a clue to his devotion in the afterword. After spending most of his life avoiding his own father, speaking only rarely on the phone, Ware finally met up with him: 'Gradually, the sublime outrageousness of our evening eroded into two people simply running out of things to say to each other. We weren't father and son anymore, just a pair of regretful men.'

Oppel also examines Benâs teenage angst over his own personal relationships, and the ethics of animal experimentation in this absorbing novel.

Jennifer Niven's deeply compelling and highly successful first teen novel All The Bright Places was very much for an older audience with its themes of depression and suicide. Her new book Holding Up the Universe is suitable for younger teens as well - and just as powerfully written. The book is narrated in turns by Libby, famous for once being 'America's Fattest Teen' and starting high school after years of being home schooled, and Jack, who seems to be one of the popular kids but secretly suffers from Prospagnosia - the inability to recognise the faces of familiar people even those in this own family which is often called 'face blindness'. Their worlds collide in a horribly cruel high school game and an unlikely friendship is formed that leads to something even deeper. Jennifer Niven is a gorgeous writer. Her characters Libby and Jack feel so real that it's almost impossible to believe they don't live and breathe. The author herself struggled with weight issues and anxiety over the years, particularly as a teenager, so this writing comes from the heart. The spotlight on prosopagnosia sheds an interesting light on a little known but not so uncommon condition. The ultimate message is uplifting and positive and one that teenagers everywhere need to hear: be yourself and you deserve to be wanted and loved for who you are.Â

The comic-strip adventures of Calvin, a naughty boy with a philosophical bent, and his soft toy tiger companion Hobbes, delighted readers from 1985 to 1995. The huge achievement of the comic's creator Bill Watterson is celebrated here in this wonderful cloth-bound three-volume box set, which contains in chronological order every Calvin and Hobbes strip. For those who have never experienced the sheer delight of Watterson's creation, here is a brief summary: Calvin is an active and imaginative little boy; his friend Hobbes appears as a stuffed tiger when other people are around, but when the two of them are alone he comes to life and is Calvin's friend and playmate. They live with Calvin's long-suffering parents, who have to cope with his turbulent behaviour. The charm of the strip is multi-faceted. On the one hand, Calvin is a typical six-year-old with a vivid imagination: one minute he is fearless intergalactic traveller Spaceman Spiff, crash-landing on a hostile planet, the next he is a fearsome T-Rex stalking his victim through the Jurassic jungle. He is in thrall to consumerism, hates school, loves making gruesome snowmen, and plays Calvinball, an anarchic game of ever-changing rules. Yet he is also given to philosophising about the big issues of life, ably supported or gently undermined by Hobbes's quietly caustic asides . Here is an outlet for Watterson's deeply-held views about the craziness of the modern world; indeed, the artist himself has always shunned publicity. The strip is also enhanced by its strong cast of supporting characters. Mrs Wormwood the teacher looms over Calvin when he not paying attention; the school bully is always on hand to 'pound' him; Susie, the little girl from down the road, often gets her own back on her snowball-throwing nemesis. Calvin's dad is a particularly funny creation: long-suffering, anti-media, and a proponent of fresh air, he also manages to get his revenge on his manic son by tying him up in mental knots with spurious bits of information . All these ingredients would, in the right hands, combine to make a perfectly good comic strip, but what always put Calvin and Hobbes ahead of the competition was the sheer artistry of Watterson's illustrations. In this regard, the chronological arrangement of the strips usefully shows Watterson's increasingly sophisticated technique, from his drawings of desert canyons and hideous inhabitants of alien planets, to the facial expressions of all his characters. It is hard to deny that Watterson owes a debt to Charles Schulz, whose Peanuts strip also offered a sophisticated yet deceptively simple evocation of the inner lives of children. For Calvin and Hobbes, however, Watterson combined uncanny ability, more than a touch of surrealism and a huge dose of humour to distil the essence of late-twentieth-century childhood, thereby elevating his strip into a league of its own.

This extraordinary graphic novel is so obviously a labour of love that the reader can only marvel at the energy that has been expended in its creation. Although the two plots that make up the book are essentially simple, the care with which Ware has executed them gives them an almost mythic quality. Jimmy Corrigan is a lonely, single, thirty-something with a boring job in an office cubicle, and a domineering mother who, in spite of living in a nursing home, is never far from the telephone or Jimmy. His crippling shyness renders him incapable of even saying hello to Peggy, the woman who works at an adjacent desk. When the father he has never known sends him an invitation and a plane ticket, Jimmy feels compelled to fly out to meet him. Jimmy's trip is mirrored by the boyhood tale of his grandfather, James, whose relationship with his father is tainted by unhappiness. Young James's mother has died, leaving his father with the unwanted job of bringing up the little boy alone, while at the same time maintaining his job as a glazier at the 1892 Chicago World's Fair. James is a frightened little boy, cowed by his father and bullied at school; he has a vagueness and fragility common to young, lonely and fearful children, qualities that are inherited generations later by his grandson. Chris Ware's illustrations are simply awe-inspiring in the true sense of the word. It is hard to believe that someone could put so much detail into each of the 380 pages that make up this incredible book, but there is a clue to his devotion in the afterword. After spending most of his life avoiding his own father, speaking only rarely on the phone, Ware finally met up with him: 'Gradually, the sublime outrageousness of our evening eroded into two people simply running out of things to say to each other. We weren't father and son anymore, just a pair of regretful men.'

Oppel also examines Benâs teenage angst over his own personal relationships, and the ethics of animal experimentation in this absorbing novel.

Jennifer Niven's deeply compelling and highly successful first teen novel All The Bright Places was very much for an older audience with its themes of depression and suicide. Her new book Holding Up the Universe is suitable for younger teens as well - and just as powerfully written. The book is narrated in turns by Libby, famous for once being 'America's Fattest Teen' and starting high school after years of being home schooled, and Jack, who seems to be one of the popular kids but secretly suffers from Prospagnosia - the inability to recognise the faces of familiar people even those in this own family which is often called 'face blindness'. Their worlds collide in a horribly cruel high school game and an unlikely friendship is formed that leads to something even deeper. Jennifer Niven is a gorgeous writer. Her characters Libby and Jack feel so real that it's almost impossible to believe they don't live and breathe. The author herself struggled with weight issues and anxiety over the years, particularly as a teenager, so this writing comes from the heart. The spotlight on prosopagnosia sheds an interesting light on a little known but not so uncommon condition. The ultimate message is uplifting and positive and one that teenagers everywhere need to hear: be yourself and you deserve to be wanted and loved for who you are.Â

The comic-strip adventures of Calvin, a naughty boy with a philosophical bent, and his soft toy tiger companion Hobbes, delighted readers from 1985 to 1995. The huge achievement of the comic's creator Bill Watterson is celebrated here in this wonderful cloth-bound three-volume box set, which contains in chronological order every Calvin and Hobbes strip. For those who have never experienced the sheer delight of Watterson's creation, here is a brief summary: Calvin is an active and imaginative little boy; his friend Hobbes appears as a stuffed tiger when other people are around, but when the two of them are alone he comes to life and is Calvin's friend and playmate. They live with Calvin's long-suffering parents, who have to cope with his turbulent behaviour. The charm of the strip is multi-faceted. On the one hand, Calvin is a typical six-year-old with a vivid imagination: one minute he is fearless intergalactic traveller Spaceman Spiff, crash-landing on a hostile planet, the next he is a fearsome T-Rex stalking his victim through the Jurassic jungle. He is in thrall to consumerism, hates school, loves making gruesome snowmen, and plays Calvinball, an anarchic game of ever-changing rules. Yet he is also given to philosophising about the big issues of life, ably supported or gently undermined by Hobbes's quietly caustic asides . Here is an outlet for Watterson's deeply-held views about the craziness of the modern world; indeed, the artist himself has always shunned publicity. The strip is also enhanced by its strong cast of supporting characters. Mrs Wormwood the teacher looms over Calvin when he not paying attention; the school bully is always on hand to 'pound' him; Susie, the little girl from down the road, often gets her own back on her snowball-throwing nemesis. Calvin's dad is a particularly funny creation: long-suffering, anti-media, and a proponent of fresh air, he also manages to get his revenge on his manic son by tying him up in mental knots with spurious bits of information . All these ingredients would, in the right hands, combine to make a perfectly good comic strip, but what always put Calvin and Hobbes ahead of the competition was the sheer artistry of Watterson's illustrations. In this regard, the chronological arrangement of the strips usefully shows Watterson's increasingly sophisticated technique, from his drawings of desert canyons and hideous inhabitants of alien planets, to the facial expressions of all his characters. It is hard to deny that Watterson owes a debt to Charles Schulz, whose Peanuts strip also offered a sophisticated yet deceptively simple evocation of the inner lives of children. For Calvin and Hobbes, however, Watterson combined uncanny ability, more than a touch of surrealism and a huge dose of humour to distil the essence of late-twentieth-century childhood, thereby elevating his strip into a league of its own.

This extraordinary graphic novel is so obviously a labour of love that the reader can only marvel at the energy that has been expended in its creation. Although the two plots that make up the book are essentially simple, the care with which Ware has executed them gives them an almost mythic quality. Jimmy Corrigan is a lonely, single, thirty-something with a boring job in an office cubicle, and a domineering mother who, in spite of living in a nursing home, is never far from the telephone or Jimmy. His crippling shyness renders him incapable of even saying hello to Peggy, the woman who works at an adjacent desk. When the father he has never known sends him an invitation and a plane ticket, Jimmy feels compelled to fly out to meet him. Jimmy's trip is mirrored by the boyhood tale of his grandfather, James, whose relationship with his father is tainted by unhappiness. Young James's mother has died, leaving his father with the unwanted job of bringing up the little boy alone, while at the same time maintaining his job as a glazier at the 1892 Chicago World's Fair. James is a frightened little boy, cowed by his father and bullied at school; he has a vagueness and fragility common to young, lonely and fearful children, qualities that are inherited generations later by his grandson. Chris Ware's illustrations are simply awe-inspiring in the true sense of the word. It is hard to believe that someone could put so much detail into each of the 380 pages that make up this incredible book, but there is a clue to his devotion in the afterword. After spending most of his life avoiding his own father, speaking only rarely on the phone, Ware finally met up with him: 'Gradually, the sublime outrageousness of our evening eroded into two people simply running out of things to say to each other. We weren't father and son anymore, just a pair of regretful men.'

Readers are drawn into the tension between the emotional bond which Ben and his mother form with Zan, the demands of the research which dominate the attitude of Ben's more inhibited father, and the increasingly fraught relationship he has with his wife and son. Oppel also examines Benâs teenage angst over his own personal relationships, and the ethics of animal experimentation in this absorbing novel.

Jennifer Niven's deeply compelling and highly successful first teen novel All The Bright Places was very much for an older audience with its themes of depression and suicide. Her new book Holding Up the Universe is suitable for younger teens as well - and just as powerfully written. The book is narrated in turns by Libby, famous for once being 'America's Fattest Teen' and starting high school after years of being home schooled, and Jack, who seems to be one of the popular kids but secretly suffers from Prospagnosia - the inability to recognise the faces of familiar people even those in this own family which is often called 'face blindness'. Their worlds collide in a horribly cruel high school game and an unlikely friendship is formed that leads to something even deeper. Jennifer Niven is a gorgeous writer. Her characters Libby and Jack feel so real that it's almost impossible to believe they don't live and breathe. The author herself struggled with weight issues and anxiety over the years, particularly as a teenager, so this writing comes from the heart. The spotlight on prosopagnosia sheds an interesting light on a little known but not so uncommon condition. The ultimate message is uplifting and positive and one that teenagers everywhere need to hear: be yourself and you deserve to be wanted and loved for who you are.Â

The comic-strip adventures of Calvin, a naughty boy with a philosophical bent, and his soft toy tiger companion Hobbes, delighted readers from 1985 to 1995. The huge achievement of the comic's creator Bill Watterson is celebrated here in this wonderful cloth-bound three-volume box set, which contains in chronological order every Calvin and Hobbes strip. For those who have never experienced the sheer delight of Watterson's creation, here is a brief summary: Calvin is an active and imaginative little boy; his friend Hobbes appears as a stuffed tiger when other people are around, but when the two of them are alone he comes to life and is Calvin's friend and playmate. They live with Calvin's long-suffering parents, who have to cope with his turbulent behaviour. The charm of the strip is multi-faceted. On the one hand, Calvin is a typical six-year-old with a vivid imagination: one minute he is fearless intergalactic traveller Spaceman Spiff, crash-landing on a hostile planet, the next he is a fearsome T-Rex stalking his victim through the Jurassic jungle. He is in thrall to consumerism, hates school, loves making gruesome snowmen, and plays Calvinball, an anarchic game of ever-changing rules. Yet he is also given to philosophising about the big issues of life, ably supported or gently undermined by Hobbes's quietly caustic asides . Here is an outlet for Watterson's deeply-held views about the craziness of the modern world; indeed, the artist himself has always shunned publicity. The strip is also enhanced by its strong cast of supporting characters. Mrs Wormwood the teacher looms over Calvin when he not paying attention; the school bully is always on hand to 'pound' him; Susie, the little girl from down the road, often gets her own back on her snowball-throwing nemesis. Calvin's dad is a particularly funny creation: long-suffering, anti-media, and a proponent of fresh air, he also manages to get his revenge on his manic son by tying him up in mental knots with spurious bits of information . All these ingredients would, in the right hands, combine to make a perfectly good comic strip, but what always put Calvin and Hobbes ahead of the competition was the sheer artistry of Watterson's illustrations. In this regard, the chronological arrangement of the strips usefully shows Watterson's increasingly sophisticated technique, from his drawings of desert canyons and hideous inhabitants of alien planets, to the facial expressions of all his characters. It is hard to deny that Watterson owes a debt to Charles Schulz, whose Peanuts strip also offered a sophisticated yet deceptively simple evocation of the inner lives of children. For Calvin and Hobbes, however, Watterson combined uncanny ability, more than a touch of surrealism and a huge dose of humour to distil the essence of late-twentieth-century childhood, thereby elevating his strip into a league of its own.

This extraordinary graphic novel is so obviously a labour of love that the reader can only marvel at the energy that has been expended in its creation. Although the two plots that make up the book are essentially simple, the care with which Ware has executed them gives them an almost mythic quality. Jimmy Corrigan is a lonely, single, thirty-something with a boring job in an office cubicle, and a domineering mother who, in spite of living in a nursing home, is never far from the telephone or Jimmy. His crippling shyness renders him incapable of even saying hello to Peggy, the woman who works at an adjacent desk. When the father he has never known sends him an invitation and a plane ticket, Jimmy feels compelled to fly out to meet him. Jimmy's trip is mirrored by the boyhood tale of his grandfather, James, whose relationship with his father is tainted by unhappiness. Young James's mother has died, leaving his father with the unwanted job of bringing up the little boy alone, while at the same time maintaining his job as a glazier at the 1892 Chicago World's Fair. James is a frightened little boy, cowed by his father and bullied at school; he has a vagueness and fragility common to young, lonely and fearful children, qualities that are inherited generations later by his grandson. Chris Ware's illustrations are simply awe-inspiring in the true sense of the word. It is hard to believe that someone could put so much detail into each of the 380 pages that make up this incredible book, but there is a clue to his devotion in the afterword. After spending most of his life avoiding his own father, speaking only rarely on the phone, Ware finally met up with him: 'Gradually, the sublime outrageousness of our evening eroded into two people simply running out of things to say to each other. We weren't father and son anymore, just a pair of regretful men.'

Readers are drawn into the tension between the emotional bond which Ben and his mother form with Zan, the demands of the research which dominate the attitude of Ben's more inhibited father, and the increasingly fraught relationship he has with his wife and son. Oppel also examines Benâs teenage angst over his own personal relationships, and the ethics of animal experimentation in this absorbing novel.

Jennifer Niven's deeply compelling and highly successful first teen novel All The Bright Places was very much for an older audience with its themes of depression and suicide. Her new book Holding Up the Universe is suitable for younger teens as well - and just as powerfully written. The book is narrated in turns by Libby, famous for once being 'America's Fattest Teen' and starting high school after years of being home schooled, and Jack, who seems to be one of the popular kids but secretly suffers from Prospagnosia - the inability to recognise the faces of familiar people even those in this own family which is often called 'face blindness'. Their worlds collide in a horribly cruel high school game and an unlikely friendship is formed that leads to something even deeper. Jennifer Niven is a gorgeous writer. Her characters Libby and Jack feel so real that it's almost impossible to believe they don't live and breathe. The author herself struggled with weight issues and anxiety over the years, particularly as a teenager, so this writing comes from the heart. The spotlight on prosopagnosia sheds an interesting light on a little known but not so uncommon condition. The ultimate message is uplifting and positive and one that teenagers everywhere need to hear: be yourself and you deserve to be wanted and loved for who you are.Â

The comic-strip adventures of Calvin, a naughty boy with a philosophical bent, and his soft toy tiger companion Hobbes, delighted readers from 1985 to 1995. The huge achievement of the comic's creator Bill Watterson is celebrated here in this wonderful cloth-bound three-volume box set, which contains in chronological order every Calvin and Hobbes strip. For those who have never experienced the sheer delight of Watterson's creation, here is a brief summary: Calvin is an active and imaginative little boy; his friend Hobbes appears as a stuffed tiger when other people are around, but when the two of them are alone he comes to life and is Calvin's friend and playmate. They live with Calvin's long-suffering parents, who have to cope with his turbulent behaviour. The charm of the strip is multi-faceted. On the one hand, Calvin is a typical six-year-old with a vivid imagination: one minute he is fearless intergalactic traveller Spaceman Spiff, crash-landing on a hostile planet, the next he is a fearsome T-Rex stalking his victim through the Jurassic jungle. He is in thrall to consumerism, hates school, loves making gruesome snowmen, and plays Calvinball, an anarchic game of ever-changing rules. Yet he is also given to philosophising about the big issues of life, ably supported or gently undermined by Hobbes's quietly caustic asides . Here is an outlet for Watterson's deeply-held views about the craziness of the modern world; indeed, the artist himself has always shunned publicity. The strip is also enhanced by its strong cast of supporting characters. Mrs Wormwood the teacher looms over Calvin when he not paying attention; the school bully is always on hand to 'pound' him; Susie, the little girl from down the road, often gets her own back on her snowball-throwing nemesis. Calvin's dad is a particularly funny creation: long-suffering, anti-media, and a proponent of fresh air, he also manages to get his revenge on his manic son by tying him up in mental knots with spurious bits of information . All these ingredients would, in the right hands, combine to make a perfectly good comic strip, but what always put Calvin and Hobbes ahead of the competition was the sheer artistry of Watterson's illustrations. In this regard, the chronological arrangement of the strips usefully shows Watterson's increasingly sophisticated technique, from his drawings of desert canyons and hideous inhabitants of alien planets, to the facial expressions of all his characters. It is hard to deny that Watterson owes a debt to Charles Schulz, whose Peanuts strip also offered a sophisticated yet deceptively simple evocation of the inner lives of children. For Calvin and Hobbes, however, Watterson combined uncanny ability, more than a touch of surrealism and a huge dose of humour to distil the essence of late-twentieth-century childhood, thereby elevating his strip into a league of its own.

On the eve of battle, Sir Thomas Lemuel Hawke of Cornwall writes a letter to his children. It is a guide on how to live well, like a knight: staying wise, humble, courageous, loving and kind. Hawke has tried to make this book look as authentic as possible. The cover stands out with a gold-embossed leaf. Inside, an editorâs note talks about the discovery of the âhistoricalâ letter, confirming Sir Thomas's death at the Battle of Slaughter Bridge in 1483.It all gives the book an important and timeless feel. Hawke has a way with a sentence, and many of the sections read like note-perfect proverbs. There are also some lovely, tender scenes with the grandfather.

This extraordinary graphic novel is so obviously a labour of love that the reader can only marvel at the energy that has been expended in its creation. Although the two plots that make up the book are essentially simple, the care with which Ware has executed them gives them an almost mythic quality. Jimmy Corrigan is a lonely, single, thirty-something with a boring job in an office cubicle, and a domineering mother who, in spite of living in a nursing home, is never far from the telephone or Jimmy. His crippling shyness renders him incapable of even saying hello to Peggy, the woman who works at an adjacent desk. When the father he has never known sends him an invitation and a plane ticket, Jimmy feels compelled to fly out to meet him. Jimmy's trip is mirrored by the boyhood tale of his grandfather, James, whose relationship with his father is tainted by unhappiness. Young James's mother has died, leaving his father with the unwanted job of bringing up the little boy alone, while at the same time maintaining his job as a glazier at the 1892 Chicago World's Fair. James is a frightened little boy, cowed by his father and bullied at school; he has a vagueness and fragility common to young, lonely and fearful children, qualities that are inherited generations later by his grandson. Chris Ware's illustrations are simply awe-inspiring in the true sense of the word. It is hard to believe that someone could put so much detail into each of the 380 pages that make up this incredible book, but there is a clue to his devotion in the afterword. After spending most of his life avoiding his own father, speaking only rarely on the phone, Ware finally met up with him: 'Gradually, the sublime outrageousness of our evening eroded into two people simply running out of things to say to each other. We weren't father and son anymore, just a pair of regretful men.'

Jennifer Niven's deeply compelling and highly successful first teen novel All The Bright Places was very much for an older audience with its themes of depression and suicide. Her new book Holding Up the Universe is suitable for younger teens as well - and just as powerfully written. The book is narrated in turns by Libby, famous for once being 'America's Fattest Teen' and starting high school after years of being home schooled, and Jack, who seems to be one of the popular kids but secretly suffers from Prospagnosia - the inability to recognise the faces of familiar people even those in this own family which is often called 'face blindness'. Their worlds collide in a horribly cruel high school game and an unlikely friendship is formed that leads to something even deeper. Jennifer Niven is a gorgeous writer. Her characters Libby and Jack feel so real that it's almost impossible to believe they don't live and breathe. The author herself struggled with weight issues and anxiety over the years, particularly as a teenager, so this writing comes from the heart. The spotlight on prosopagnosia sheds an interesting light on a little known but not so uncommon condition. The ultimate message is uplifting and positive and one that teenagers everywhere need to hear: be yourself and you deserve to be wanted and loved for who you are.Â

The comic-strip adventures of Calvin, a naughty boy with a philosophical bent, and his soft toy tiger companion Hobbes, delighted readers from 1985 to 1995. The huge achievement of the comic's creator Bill Watterson is celebrated here in this wonderful cloth-bound three-volume box set, which contains in chronological order every Calvin and Hobbes strip. For those who have never experienced the sheer delight of Watterson's creation, here is a brief summary: Calvin is an active and imaginative little boy; his friend Hobbes appears as a stuffed tiger when other people are around, but when the two of them are alone he comes to life and is Calvin's friend and playmate. They live with Calvin's long-suffering parents, who have to cope with his turbulent behaviour. The charm of the strip is multi-faceted. On the one hand, Calvin is a typical six-year-old with a vivid imagination: one minute he is fearless intergalactic traveller Spaceman Spiff, crash-landing on a hostile planet, the next he is a fearsome T-Rex stalking his victim through the Jurassic jungle. He is in thrall to consumerism, hates school, loves making gruesome snowmen, and plays Calvinball, an anarchic game of ever-changing rules. Yet he is also given to philosophising about the big issues of life, ably supported or gently undermined by Hobbes's quietly caustic asides . Here is an outlet for Watterson's deeply-held views about the craziness of the modern world; indeed, the artist himself has always shunned publicity. The strip is also enhanced by its strong cast of supporting characters. Mrs Wormwood the teacher looms over Calvin when he not paying attention; the school bully is always on hand to 'pound' him; Susie, the little girl from down the road, often gets her own back on her snowball-throwing nemesis. Calvin's dad is a particularly funny creation: long-suffering, anti-media, and a proponent of fresh air, he also manages to get his revenge on his manic son by tying him up in mental knots with spurious bits of information . All these ingredients would, in the right hands, combine to make a perfectly good comic strip, but what always put Calvin and Hobbes ahead of the competition was the sheer artistry of Watterson's illustrations. In this regard, the chronological arrangement of the strips usefully shows Watterson's increasingly sophisticated technique, from his drawings of desert canyons and hideous inhabitants of alien planets, to the facial expressions of all his characters. It is hard to deny that Watterson owes a debt to Charles Schulz, whose Peanuts strip also offered a sophisticated yet deceptively simple evocation of the inner lives of children. For Calvin and Hobbes, however, Watterson combined uncanny ability, more than a touch of surrealism and a huge dose of humour to distil the essence of late-twentieth-century childhood, thereby elevating his strip into a league of its own.

On the eve of battle, Sir Thomas Lemuel Hawke of Cornwall writes a letter to his children. It is a guide on how to live well, like a knight: staying wise, humble, courageous, loving and kind. Hawke has tried to make this book look as authentic as possible. The cover stands out with a gold-embossed leaf. Inside, an editorâs note talks about the discovery of the âhistoricalâ letter, confirming Sir Thomas's death at the Battle of Slaughter Bridge in 1483.It all gives the book an important and timeless feel. Hawke has a way with a sentence, and many of the sections read like note-perfect proverbs. There are also some lovely, tender scenes with the grandfather.

This extraordinary graphic novel is so obviously a labour of love that the reader can only marvel at the energy that has been expended in its creation. Although the two plots that make up the book are essentially simple, the care with which Ware has executed them gives them an almost mythic quality. Jimmy Corrigan is a lonely, single, thirty-something with a boring job in an office cubicle, and a domineering mother who, in spite of living in a nursing home, is never far from the telephone or Jimmy. His crippling shyness renders him incapable of even saying hello to Peggy, the woman who works at an adjacent desk. When the father he has never known sends him an invitation and a plane ticket, Jimmy feels compelled to fly out to meet him. Jimmy's trip is mirrored by the boyhood tale of his grandfather, James, whose relationship with his father is tainted by unhappiness. Young James's mother has died, leaving his father with the unwanted job of bringing up the little boy alone, while at the same time maintaining his job as a glazier at the 1892 Chicago World's Fair. James is a frightened little boy, cowed by his father and bullied at school; he has a vagueness and fragility common to young, lonely and fearful children, qualities that are inherited generations later by his grandson. Chris Ware's illustrations are simply awe-inspiring in the true sense of the word. It is hard to believe that someone could put so much detail into each of the 380 pages that make up this incredible book, but there is a clue to his devotion in the afterword. After spending most of his life avoiding his own father, speaking only rarely on the phone, Ware finally met up with him: 'Gradually, the sublime outrageousness of our evening eroded into two people simply running out of things to say to each other. We weren't father and son anymore, just a pair of regretful men.'

The comic-strip adventures of Calvin, a naughty boy with a philosophical bent, and his soft toy tiger companion Hobbes, delighted readers from 1985 to 1995. The huge achievement of the comic's creator Bill Watterson is celebrated here in this wonderful cloth-bound three-volume box set, which contains in chronological order every Calvin and Hobbes strip. For those who have never experienced the sheer delight of Watterson's creation, here is a brief summary: Calvin is an active and imaginative little boy; his friend Hobbes appears as a stuffed tiger when other people are around, but when the two of them are alone he comes to life and is Calvin's friend and playmate. They live with Calvin's long-suffering parents, who have to cope with his turbulent behaviour. The charm of the strip is multi-faceted. On the one hand, Calvin is a typical six-year-old with a vivid imagination: one minute he is fearless intergalactic traveller Spaceman Spiff, crash-landing on a hostile planet, the next he is a fearsome T-Rex stalking his victim through the Jurassic jungle. He is in thrall to consumerism, hates school, loves making gruesome snowmen, and plays Calvinball, an anarchic game of ever-changing rules. Yet he is also given to philosophising about the big issues of life, ably supported or gently undermined by Hobbes's quietly caustic asides . Here is an outlet for Watterson's deeply-held views about the craziness of the modern world; indeed, the artist himself has always shunned publicity. The strip is also enhanced by its strong cast of supporting characters. Mrs Wormwood the teacher looms over Calvin when he not paying attention; the school bully is always on hand to 'pound' him; Susie, the little girl from down the road, often gets her own back on her snowball-throwing nemesis. Calvin's dad is a particularly funny creation: long-suffering, anti-media, and a proponent of fresh air, he also manages to get his revenge on his manic son by tying him up in mental knots with spurious bits of information . All these ingredients would, in the right hands, combine to make a perfectly good comic strip, but what always put Calvin and Hobbes ahead of the competition was the sheer artistry of Watterson's illustrations. In this regard, the chronological arrangement of the strips usefully shows Watterson's increasingly sophisticated technique, from his drawings of desert canyons and hideous inhabitants of alien planets, to the facial expressions of all his characters. It is hard to deny that Watterson owes a debt to Charles Schulz, whose Peanuts strip also offered a sophisticated yet deceptively simple evocation of the inner lives of children. For Calvin and Hobbes, however, Watterson combined uncanny ability, more than a touch of surrealism and a huge dose of humour to distil the essence of late-twentieth-century childhood, thereby elevating his strip into a league of its own.

Jennifer Niven's deeply compelling and highly successful first teen novel All The Bright Places was very much for an older audience with its themes of depression and suicide. Her new book Holding Up the Universe is suitable for younger teens as well - and just as powerfully written. The book is narrated in turns by Libby, famous for once being 'America's Fattest Teen' and starting high school after years of being home schooled, and Jack, who seems to be one of the popular kids but secretly suffers from Prospagnosia - the inability to recognise the faces of familiar people even those in this own family which is often called 'face blindness'. Their worlds collide in a horribly cruel high school game and an unlikely friendship is formed that leads to something even deeper. Jennifer Niven is a gorgeous writer. Her characters Libby and Jack feel so real that it's almost impossible to believe they don't live and breathe. The author herself struggled with weight issues and anxiety over the years, particularly as a teenager, so this writing comes from the heart. The spotlight on prosopagnosia sheds an interesting light on a little known but not so uncommon condition. The ultimate message is uplifting and positive and one that teenagers everywhere need to hear: be yourself and you deserve to be wanted and loved for who you are.Â

The comic-strip adventures of Calvin, a naughty boy with a philosophical bent, and his soft toy tiger companion Hobbes, delighted readers from 1985 to 1995. The huge achievement of the comic's creator Bill Watterson is celebrated here in this wonderful cloth-bound three-volume box set, which contains in chronological order every Calvin and Hobbes strip. For those who have never experienced the sheer delight of Watterson's creation, here is a brief summary: Calvin is an active and imaginative little boy; his friend Hobbes appears as a stuffed tiger when other people are around, but when the two of them are alone he comes to life and is Calvin's friend and playmate. They live with Calvin's long-suffering parents, who have to cope with his turbulent behaviour. The charm of the strip is multi-faceted. On the one hand, Calvin is a typical six-year-old with a vivid imagination: one minute he is fearless intergalactic traveller Spaceman Spiff, crash-landing on a hostile planet, the next he is a fearsome T-Rex stalking his victim through the Jurassic jungle. He is in thrall to consumerism, hates school, loves making gruesome snowmen, and plays Calvinball, an anarchic game of ever-changing rules. Yet he is also given to philosophising about the big issues of life, ably supported or gently undermined by Hobbes's quietly caustic asides . Here is an outlet for Watterson's deeply-held views about the craziness of the modern world; indeed, the artist himself has always shunned publicity. The strip is also enhanced by its strong cast of supporting characters. Mrs Wormwood the teacher looms over Calvin when he not paying attention; the school bully is always on hand to 'pound' him; Susie, the little girl from down the road, often gets her own back on her snowball-throwing nemesis. Calvin's dad is a particularly funny creation: long-suffering, anti-media, and a proponent of fresh air, he also manages to get his revenge on his manic son by tying him up in mental knots with spurious bits of information . All these ingredients would, in the right hands, combine to make a perfectly good comic strip, but what always put Calvin and Hobbes ahead of the competition was the sheer artistry of Watterson's illustrations. In this regard, the chronological arrangement of the strips usefully shows Watterson's increasingly sophisticated technique, from his drawings of desert canyons and hideous inhabitants of alien planets, to the facial expressions of all his characters. It is hard to deny that Watterson owes a debt to Charles Schulz, whose Peanuts strip also offered a sophisticated yet deceptively simple evocation of the inner lives of children. For Calvin and Hobbes, however, Watterson combined uncanny ability, more than a touch of surrealism and a huge dose of humour to distil the essence of late-twentieth-century childhood, thereby elevating his strip into a league of its own.

This extraordinary graphic novel is so obviously a labour of love that the reader can only marvel at the energy that has been expended in its creation. Although the two plots that make up the book are essentially simple, the care with which Ware has executed them gives them an almost mythic quality. Jimmy Corrigan is a lonely, single, thirty-something with a boring job in an office cubicle, and a domineering mother who, in spite of living in a nursing home, is never far from the telephone or Jimmy. His crippling shyness renders him incapable of even saying hello to Peggy, the woman who works at an adjacent desk. When the father he has never known sends him an invitation and a plane ticket, Jimmy feels compelled to fly out to meet him. Jimmy's trip is mirrored by the boyhood tale of his grandfather, James, whose relationship with his father is tainted by unhappiness. Young James's mother has died, leaving his father with the unwanted job of bringing up the little boy alone, while at the same time maintaining his job as a glazier at the 1892 Chicago World's Fair. James is a frightened little boy, cowed by his father and bullied at school; he has a vagueness and fragility common to young, lonely and fearful children, qualities that are inherited generations later by his grandson. Chris Ware's illustrations are simply awe-inspiring in the true sense of the word. It is hard to believe that someone could put so much detail into each of the 380 pages that make up this incredible book, but there is a clue to his devotion in the afterword. After spending most of his life avoiding his own father, speaking only rarely on the phone, Ware finally met up with him: 'Gradually, the sublime outrageousness of our evening eroded into two people simply running out of things to say to each other. We weren't father and son anymore, just a pair of regretful men.'

Every year, the evil Protectorate offers a baby to the evil witch in the forest to ensure their villageâs safety. Yet, unknown to them, the witch is Xan, the plump and knowledgeable protector of the babies that she takes to the neighbouring village to be raised as special children, fed on starlight and destined to do wonderful things. Yet, one day, Xan feeds one baby the moon by mistake and fills her with a huge amount of magicÂ â a dangerous amount, as it turns outÂ â so Xan decides to raise Luna as her own. But nothing is straightforward, and when Luna turns 13, everything will change. Kelly Barnhill won the Newbery Medal in the US for this thoughtful and magical book about belonging, fear and family, and itâs easy to see why. The writing flows beautifully and Barnhillâs keen observation of human nature fits naturally into the story, which moves along at a satisfying pace. Xan is a delightfully pleasant and caring crone witch who dispels the traditional image of cackling evildoer, and replaces it with something far more loving and magical. Neil Gaiman, Ursula Le Guin and Diana Wynne Jones.

Inside, an editorâs note talks about the discovery of the âhistoricalâ letter, confirming Sir Thomas's death at the Battle of Slaughter Bridge in 1483.It all gives the book an important and timeless feel. Hawke has a way with a sentence, and many of the sections read like note-perfect proverbs. There are also some lovely, tender scenes with the grandfather. It can be a little dense at times, so children may want to dip in and out of the short, standalone chapters. But the book is pitched in such a way that they can get new meaning from it as they grow into teenagers and young adults.

This extraordinary graphic novel is so obviously a labour of love that the reader can only marvel at the energy that has been expended in its creation. Although the two plots that make up the book are essentially simple, the care with which Ware has executed them gives them an almost mythic quality. Jimmy Corrigan is a lonely, single, thirty-something with a boring job in an office cubicle, and a domineering mother who, in spite of living in a nursing home, is never far from the telephone or Jimmy. His crippling shyness renders him incapable of even saying hello to Peggy, the woman who works at an adjacent desk. When the father he has never known sends him an invitation and a plane ticket, Jimmy feels compelled to fly out to meet him. Jimmy's trip is mirrored by the boyhood tale of his grandfather, James, whose relationship with his father is tainted by unhappiness. Young James's mother has died, leaving his father with the unwanted job of bringing up the little boy alone, while at the same time maintaining his job as a glazier at the 1892 Chicago World's Fair. James is a frightened little boy, cowed by his father and bullied at school; he has a vagueness and fragility common to young, lonely and fearful children, qualities that are inherited generations later by his grandson. Chris Ware's illustrations are simply awe-inspiring in the true sense of the word. It is hard to believe that someone could put so much detail into each of the 380 pages that make up this incredible book, but there is a clue to his devotion in the afterword. After spending most of his life avoiding his own father, speaking only rarely on the phone, Ware finally met up with him: 'Gradually, the sublime outrageousness of our evening eroded into two people simply running out of things to say to each other. We weren't father and son anymore, just a pair of regretful men.'

Every year, the evil Protectorate offers a baby to the evil witch in the forest to ensure their villageâs safety. Yet, unknown to them, the witch is Xan, the plump and knowledgeable protector of the babies that she takes to the neighbouring village to be raised as special children, fed on starlight and destined to do wonderful things. Yet, one day, Xan feeds one baby the moon by mistake and fills her with a huge amount of magicÂ â a dangerous amount, as it turns outÂ â so Xan decides to raise Luna as her own. But nothing is straightforward, and when Luna turns 13, everything will change. Kelly Barnhill won the Newbery Medal in the US for this thoughtful and magical book about belonging, fear and family, and itâs easy to see why. The writing flows beautifully and Barnhillâs keen observation of human nature fits naturally into the story, which moves along at a satisfying pace. Xan is a delightfully pleasant and caring crone witch who dispels the traditional image of cackling evildoer, and replaces it with something far more loving and magical.

Jennifer Niven's deeply compelling and highly successful first teen novel All The Bright Places was very much for an older audience with its themes of depression and suicide. Her new book Holding Up the Universe is suitable for younger teens as well - and just as powerfully written. The book is narrated in turns by Libby, famous for once being 'America's Fattest Teen' and starting high school after years of being home schooled, and Jack, who seems to be one of the popular kids but secretly suffers from Prospagnosia - the inability to recognise the faces of familiar people even those in this own family which is often called 'face blindness'. Their worlds collide in a horribly cruel high school game and an unlikely friendship is formed that leads to something even deeper. Jennifer Niven is a gorgeous writer. Her characters Libby and Jack feel so real that it's almost impossible to believe they don't live and breathe. The author herself struggled with weight issues and anxiety over the years, particularly as a teenager, so this writing comes from the heart. The spotlight on prosopagnosia sheds an interesting light on a little known but not so uncommon condition. The ultimate message is uplifting and positive and one that teenagers everywhere need to hear: be yourself and you deserve to be wanted and loved for who you are.Â

The comic-strip adventures of Calvin, a naughty boy with a philosophical bent, and his soft toy tiger companion Hobbes, delighted readers from 1985 to 1995. The huge achievement of the comic's creator Bill Watterson is celebrated here in this wonderful cloth-bound three-volume box set, which contains in chronological order every Calvin and Hobbes strip. For those who have never experienced the sheer delight of Watterson's creation, here is a brief summary: Calvin is an active and imaginative little boy; his friend Hobbes appears as a stuffed tiger when other people are around, but when the two of them are alone he comes to life and is Calvin's friend and playmate. They live with Calvin's long-suffering parents, who have to cope with his turbulent behaviour. The charm of the strip is multi-faceted. On the one hand, Calvin is a typical six-year-old with a vivid imagination: one minute he is fearless intergalactic traveller Spaceman Spiff, crash-landing on a hostile planet, the next he is a fearsome T-Rex stalking his victim through the Jurassic jungle. He is in thrall to consumerism, hates school, loves making gruesome snowmen, and plays Calvinball, an anarchic game of ever-changing rules. Yet he is also given to philosophising about the big issues of life, ably supported or gently undermined by Hobbes's quietly caustic asides . Here is an outlet for Watterson's deeply-held views about the craziness of the modern world; indeed, the artist himself has always shunned publicity. The strip is also enhanced by its strong cast of supporting characters. Mrs Wormwood the teacher looms over Calvin when he not paying attention; the school bully is always on hand to 'pound' him; Susie, the little girl from down the road, often gets her own back on her snowball-throwing nemesis. Calvin's dad is a particularly funny creation: long-suffering, anti-media, and a proponent of fresh air, he also manages to get his revenge on his manic son by tying him up in mental knots with spurious bits of information . All these ingredients would, in the right hands, combine to make a perfectly good comic strip, but what always put Calvin and Hobbes ahead of the competition was the sheer artistry of Watterson's illustrations. In this regard, the chronological arrangement of the strips usefully shows Watterson's increasingly sophisticated technique, from his drawings of desert canyons and hideous inhabitants of alien planets, to the facial expressions of all his characters. It is hard to deny that Watterson owes a debt to Charles Schulz, whose Peanuts strip also offered a sophisticated yet deceptively simple evocation of the inner lives of children. For Calvin and Hobbes, however, Watterson combined uncanny ability, more than a touch of surrealism and a huge dose of humour to distil the essence of late-twentieth-century childhood, thereby elevating his strip into a league of its own.

This extraordinary graphic novel is so obviously a labour of love that the reader can only marvel at the energy that has been expended in its creation. Although the two plots that make up the book are essentially simple, the care with which Ware has executed them gives them an almost mythic quality. Jimmy Corrigan is a lonely, single, thirty-something with a boring job in an office cubicle, and a domineering mother who, in spite of living in a nursing home, is never far from the telephone or Jimmy. His crippling shyness renders him incapable of even saying hello to Peggy, the woman who works at an adjacent desk. When the father he has never known sends him an invitation and a plane ticket, Jimmy feels compelled to fly out to meet him. Jimmy's trip is mirrored by the boyhood tale of his grandfather, James, whose relationship with his father is tainted by unhappiness. Young James's mother has died, leaving his father with the unwanted job of bringing up the little boy alone, while at the same time maintaining his job as a glazier at the 1892 Chicago World's Fair. James is a frightened little boy, cowed by his father and bullied at school; he has a vagueness and fragility common to young, lonely and fearful children, qualities that are inherited generations later by his grandson. Chris Ware's illustrations are simply awe-inspiring in the true sense of the word. It is hard to believe that someone could put so much detail into each of the 380 pages that make up this incredible book, but there is a clue to his devotion in the afterword. After spending most of his life avoiding his own father, speaking only rarely on the phone, Ware finally met up with him: 'Gradually, the sublime outrageousness of our evening eroded into two people simply running out of things to say to each other. We weren't father and son anymore, just a pair of regretful men.'

But when Alejandro de Castillo, a young Spanish priest joins the household, Meg finds herself in peril - and realises she is rapidly falling in love with a dangerous enemy.

Every year, the evil Protectorate offers a baby to the evil witch in the forest to ensure their villageâs safety. Yet, unknown to them, the witch is Xan, the plump and knowledgeable protector of the babies that she takes to the neighbouring village to be raised as special children, fed on starlight and destined to do wonderful things. Yet, one day, Xan feeds one baby the moon by mistake and fills her with a huge amount of magicÂ â a dangerous amount, as it turns outÂ â so Xan decides to raise Luna as her own. But nothing is straightforward, and when Luna turns 13, everything will change. Kelly Barnhill won the Newbery Medal in the US for this thoughtful and magical book about belonging, fear and family, and itâs easy to see why. The writing flows beautifully and Barnhillâs keen observation of human nature fits naturally into the story, which moves along at a satisfying pace. Xan is a delightfully pleasant and caring crone witch who dispels the traditional image of cackling evildoer, and replaces it with something far more loving and magical. Neil Gaiman, Ursula Le Guin and Diana Wynne Jones.

Jennifer Niven's deeply compelling and highly successful first teen novel All The Bright Places was very much for an older audience with its themes of depression and suicide. Her new book Holding Up the Universe is suitable for younger teens as well - and just as powerfully written. The book is narrated in turns by Libby, famous for once being 'America's Fattest Teen' and starting high school after years of being home schooled, and Jack, who seems to be one of the popular kids but secretly suffers from Prospagnosia - the inability to recognise the faces of familiar people even those in this own family which is often called 'face blindness'. Their worlds collide in a horribly cruel high school game and an unlikely friendship is formed that leads to something even deeper. Jennifer Niven is a gorgeous writer. Her characters Libby and Jack feel so real that it's almost impossible to believe they don't live and breathe. The author herself struggled with weight issues and anxiety over the years, particularly as a teenager, so this writing comes from the heart. The spotlight on prosopagnosia sheds an interesting light on a little known but not so uncommon condition. The ultimate message is uplifting and positive and one that teenagers everywhere need to hear: be yourself and you deserve to be wanted and loved for who you are.Â

The comic-strip adventures of Calvin, a naughty boy with a philosophical bent, and his soft toy tiger companion Hobbes, delighted readers from 1985 to 1995. The huge achievement of the comic's creator Bill Watterson is celebrated here in this wonderful cloth-bound three-volume box set, which contains in chronological order every Calvin and Hobbes strip. For those who have never experienced the sheer delight of Watterson's creation, here is a brief summary: Calvin is an active and imaginative little boy; his friend Hobbes appears as a stuffed tiger when other people are around, but when the two of them are alone he comes to life and is Calvin's friend and playmate. They live with Calvin's long-suffering parents, who have to cope with his turbulent behaviour. The charm of the strip is multi-faceted. On the one hand, Calvin is a typical six-year-old with a vivid imagination: one minute he is fearless intergalactic traveller Spaceman Spiff, crash-landing on a hostile planet, the next he is a fearsome T-Rex stalking his victim through the Jurassic jungle. He is in thrall to consumerism, hates school, loves making gruesome snowmen, and plays Calvinball, an anarchic game of ever-changing rules. Yet he is also given to philosophising about the big issues of life, ably supported or gently undermined by Hobbes's quietly caustic asides . Here is an outlet for Watterson's deeply-held views about the craziness of the modern world; indeed, the artist himself has always shunned publicity. The strip is also enhanced by its strong cast of supporting characters. Mrs Wormwood the teacher looms over Calvin when he not paying attention; the school bully is always on hand to 'pound' him; Susie, the little girl from down the road, often gets her own back on her snowball-throwing nemesis. Calvin's dad is a particularly funny creation: long-suffering, anti-media, and a proponent of fresh air, he also manages to get his revenge on his manic son by tying him up in mental knots with spurious bits of information . All these ingredients would, in the right hands, combine to make a perfectly good comic strip, but what always put Calvin and Hobbes ahead of the competition was the sheer artistry of Watterson's illustrations. In this regard, the chronological arrangement of the strips usefully shows Watterson's increasingly sophisticated technique, from his drawings of desert canyons and hideous inhabitants of alien planets, to the facial expressions of all his characters. It is hard to deny that Watterson owes a debt to Charles Schulz, whose Peanuts strip also offered a sophisticated yet deceptively simple evocation of the inner lives of children. For Calvin and Hobbes, however, Watterson combined uncanny ability, more than a touch of surrealism and a huge dose of humour to distil the essence of late-twentieth-century childhood, thereby elevating his strip into a league of its own.

Readers are drawn into the tension between the emotional bond which Ben and his mother form with Zan, the demands of the research which dominate the attitude of Ben's more inhibited father, and the increasingly fraught relationship he has with his wife and son. Oppel also examines Benâs teenage angst over his own personal relationships, and the ethics of animal experimentation in this absorbing novel.

Jennifer Niven's deeply compelling and highly successful first teen novel All The Bright Places was very much for an older audience with its themes of depression and suicide. Her new book Holding Up the Universe is suitable for younger teens as well - and just as powerfully written. The book is narrated in turns by Libby, famous for once being 'America's Fattest Teen' and starting high school after years of being home schooled, and Jack, who seems to be one of the popular kids but secretly suffers from Prospagnosia - the inability to recognise the faces of familiar people even those in this own family which is often called 'face blindness'. Their worlds collide in a horribly cruel high school game and an unlikely friendship is formed that leads to something even deeper. Jennifer Niven is a gorgeous writer. Her characters Libby and Jack feel so real that it's almost impossible to believe they don't live and breathe. The author herself struggled with weight issues and anxiety over the years, particularly as a teenager, so this writing comes from the heart. The spotlight on prosopagnosia sheds an interesting light on a little known but not so uncommon condition. The ultimate message is uplifting and positive and one that teenagers everywhere need to hear: be yourself and you deserve to be wanted and loved for who you are.Â

The comic-strip adventures of Calvin, a naughty boy with a philosophical bent, and his soft toy tiger companion Hobbes, delighted readers from 1985 to 1995. The huge achievement of the comic's creator Bill Watterson is celebrated here in this wonderful cloth-bound three-volume box set, which contains in chronological order every Calvin and Hobbes strip. For those who have never experienced the sheer delight of Watterson's creation, here is a brief summary: Calvin is an active and imaginative little boy; his friend Hobbes appears as a stuffed tiger when other people are around, but when the two of them are alone he comes to life and is Calvin's friend and playmate. They live with Calvin's long-suffering parents, who have to cope with his turbulent behaviour. The charm of the strip is multi-faceted. On the one hand, Calvin is a typical six-year-old with a vivid imagination: one minute he is fearless intergalactic traveller Spaceman Spiff, crash-landing on a hostile planet, the next he is a fearsome T-Rex stalking his victim through the Jurassic jungle. He is in thrall to consumerism, hates school, loves making gruesome snowmen, and plays Calvinball, an anarchic game of ever-changing rules. Yet he is also given to philosophising about the big issues of life, ably supported or gently undermined by Hobbes's quietly caustic asides . Here is an outlet for Watterson's deeply-held views about the craziness of the modern world; indeed, the artist himself has always shunned publicity. The strip is also enhanced by its strong cast of supporting characters. Mrs Wormwood the teacher looms over Calvin when he not paying attention; the school bully is always on hand to 'pound' him; Susie, the little girl from down the road, often gets her own back on her snowball-throwing nemesis. Calvin's dad is a particularly funny creation: long-suffering, anti-media, and a proponent of fresh air, he also manages to get his revenge on his manic son by tying him up in mental knots with spurious bits of information . All these ingredients would, in the right hands, combine to make a perfectly good comic strip, but what always put Calvin and Hobbes ahead of the competition was the sheer artistry of Watterson's illustrations. In this regard, the chronological arrangement of the strips usefully shows Watterson's increasingly sophisticated technique, from his drawings of desert canyons and hideous inhabitants of alien planets, to the facial expressions of all his characters. It is hard to deny that Watterson owes a debt to Charles Schulz, whose Peanuts strip also offered a sophisticated yet deceptively simple evocation of the inner lives of children. For Calvin and Hobbes, however, Watterson combined uncanny ability, more than a touch of surrealism and a huge dose of humour to distil the essence of late-twentieth-century childhood, thereby elevating his strip into a league of its own.

This extraordinary graphic novel is so obviously a labour of love that the reader can only marvel at the energy that has been expended in its creation. Although the two plots that make up the book are essentially simple, the care with which Ware has executed them gives them an almost mythic quality. Jimmy Corrigan is a lonely, single, thirty-something with a boring job in an office cubicle, and a domineering mother who, in spite of living in a nursing home, is never far from the telephone or Jimmy. His crippling shyness renders him incapable of even saying hello to Peggy, the woman who works at an adjacent desk. When the father he has never known sends him an invitation and a plane ticket, Jimmy feels compelled to fly out to meet him. Jimmy's trip is mirrored by the boyhood tale of his grandfather, James, whose relationship with his father is tainted by unhappiness. Young James's mother has died, leaving his father with the unwanted job of bringing up the little boy alone, while at the same time maintaining his job as a glazier at the 1892 Chicago World's Fair. James is a frightened little boy, cowed by his father and bullied at school; he has a vagueness and fragility common to young, lonely and fearful children, qualities that are inherited generations later by his grandson. Chris Ware's illustrations are simply awe-inspiring in the true sense of the word. It is hard to believe that someone could put so much detail into each of the 380 pages that make up this incredible book, but there is a clue to his devotion in the afterword. After spending most of his life avoiding his own father, speaking only rarely on the phone, Ware finally met up with him: 'Gradually, the sublime outrageousness of our evening eroded into two people simply running out of things to say to each other. We weren't father and son anymore, just a pair of regretful men.'

The book is narrated in turns by Libby, famous for once being 'America's Fattest Teen' and starting high school after years of being home schooled, and Jack, who seems to be one of the popular kids but secretly suffers from Prospagnosia - the inability to recognise the faces of familiar people even those in this own family which is often called 'face blindness'. Their worlds collide in a horribly cruel high school game and an unlikely friendship is formed that leads to something even deeper. Jennifer Niven is a gorgeous writer. Her characters Libby and Jack feel so real that it's almost impossible to believe they don't live and breathe. The author herself struggled with weight issues and anxiety over the years, particularly as a teenager, so this writing comes from the heart. The spotlight on prosopagnosia sheds an interesting light on a little known but not so uncommon condition. The ultimate message is uplifting and positive and one that teenagers everywhere need to hear: be yourself and you deserve to be wanted and loved for who you are.Â

The comic-strip adventures of Calvin, a naughty boy with a philosophical bent, and his soft toy tiger companion Hobbes, delighted readers from 1985 to 1995. The huge achievement of the comic's creator Bill Watterson is celebrated here in this wonderful cloth-bound three-volume box set, which contains in chronological order every Calvin and Hobbes strip. For those who have never experienced the sheer delight of Watterson's creation, here is a brief summary: Calvin is an active and imaginative little boy; his friend Hobbes appears as a stuffed tiger when other people are around, but when the two of them are alone he comes to life and is Calvin's friend and playmate. They live with Calvin's long-suffering parents, who have to cope with his turbulent behaviour. The charm of the strip is multi-faceted. On the one hand, Calvin is a typical six-year-old with a vivid imagination: one minute he is fearless intergalactic traveller Spaceman Spiff, crash-landing on a hostile planet, the next he is a fearsome T-Rex stalking his victim through the Jurassic jungle. He is in thrall to consumerism, hates school, loves making gruesome snowmen, and plays Calvinball, an anarchic game of ever-changing rules. Yet he is also given to philosophising about the big issues of life, ably supported or gently undermined by Hobbes's quietly caustic asides . Here is an outlet for Watterson's deeply-held views about the craziness of the modern world; indeed, the artist himself has always shunned publicity. The strip is also enhanced by its strong cast of supporting characters. Mrs Wormwood the teacher looms over Calvin when he not paying attention; the school bully is always on hand to 'pound' him; Susie, the little girl from down the road, often gets her own back on her snowball-throwing nemesis. Calvin's dad is a particularly funny creation: long-suffering, anti-media, and a proponent of fresh air, he also manages to get his revenge on his manic son by tying him up in mental knots with spurious bits of information . All these ingredients would, in the right hands, combine to make a perfectly good comic strip, but what always put Calvin and Hobbes ahead of the competition was the sheer artistry of Watterson's illustrations. In this regard, the chronological arrangement of the strips usefully shows Watterson's increasingly sophisticated technique, from his drawings of desert canyons and hideous inhabitants of alien planets, to the facial expressions of all his characters. It is hard to deny that Watterson owes a debt to Charles Schulz, whose Peanuts strip also offered a sophisticated yet deceptively simple evocation of the inner lives of children. For Calvin and Hobbes, however, Watterson combined uncanny ability, more than a touch of surrealism and a huge dose of humour to distil the essence of late-twentieth-century childhood, thereby elevating his strip into a league of its own.

This extraordinary graphic novel is so obviously a labour of love that the reader can only marvel at the energy that has been expended in its creation. Although the two plots that make up the book are essentially simple, the care with which Ware has executed them gives them an almost mythic quality. Jimmy Corrigan is a lonely, single, thirty-something with a boring job in an office cubicle, and a domineering mother who, in spite of living in a nursing home, is never far from the telephone or Jimmy. His crippling shyness renders him incapable of even saying hello to Peggy, the woman who works at an adjacent desk. When the father he has never known sends him an invitation and a plane ticket, Jimmy feels compelled to fly out to meet him. Jimmy's trip is mirrored by the boyhood tale of his grandfather, James, whose relationship with his father is tainted by unhappiness. Young James's mother has died, leaving his father with the unwanted job of bringing up the little boy alone, while at the same time maintaining his job as a glazier at the 1892 Chicago World's Fair. James is a frightened little boy, cowed by his father and bullied at school; he has a vagueness and fragility common to young, lonely and fearful children, qualities that are inherited generations later by his grandson. Chris Ware's illustrations are simply awe-inspiring in the true sense of the word. It is hard to believe that someone could put so much detail into each of the 380 pages that make up this incredible book, but there is a clue to his devotion in the afterword. After spending most of his life avoiding his own father, speaking only rarely on the phone, Ware finally met up with him: 'Gradually, the sublime outrageousness of our evening eroded into two people simply running out of things to say to each other. We weren't father and son anymore, just a pair of regretful men.'

Jennifer Niven's deeply compelling and highly successful first teen novel All The Bright Places was very much for an older audience with its themes of depression and suicide. Her new book Holding Up the Universe is suitable for younger teens as well - and just as powerfully written. The book is narrated in turns by Libby, famous for once being 'America's Fattest Teen' and starting high school after years of being home schooled, and Jack, who seems to be one of the popular kids but secretly suffers from Prospagnosia - the inability to recognise the faces of familiar people even those in this own family which is often called 'face blindness'. Their worlds collide in a horribly cruel high school game and an unlikely friendship is formed that leads to something even deeper. Jennifer Niven is a gorgeous writer. Her characters Libby and Jack feel so real that it's almost impossible to believe they don't live and breathe.

The comic-strip adventures of Calvin, a naughty boy with a philosophical bent, and his soft toy tiger companion Hobbes, delighted readers from 1985 to 1995. The huge achievement of the comic's creator Bill Watterson is celebrated here in this wonderful cloth-bound three-volume box set, which contains in chronological order every Calvin and Hobbes strip. For those who have never experienced the sheer delight of Watterson's creation, here is a brief summary: Calvin is an active and imaginative little boy; his friend Hobbes appears as a stuffed tiger when other people are around, but when the two of them are alone he comes to life and is Calvin's friend and playmate. They live with Calvin's long-suffering parents, who have to cope with his turbulent behaviour. The charm of the strip is multi-faceted. On the one hand, Calvin is a typical six-year-old with a vivid imagination: one minute he is fearless intergalactic traveller Spaceman Spiff, crash-landing on a hostile planet, the next he is a fearsome T-Rex stalking his victim through the Jurassic jungle. He is in thrall to consumerism, hates school, loves making gruesome snowmen, and plays Calvinball, an anarchic game of ever-changing rules. Yet he is also given to philosophising about the big issues of life, ably supported or gently undermined by Hobbes's quietly caustic asides . Here is an outlet for Watterson's deeply-held views about the craziness of the modern world; indeed, the artist himself has always shunned publicity. The strip is also enhanced by its strong cast of supporting characters. Mrs Wormwood the teacher looms over Calvin when he not paying attention; the school bully is always on hand to 'pound' him; Susie, the little girl from down the road, often gets her own back on her snowball-throwing nemesis. Calvin's dad is a particularly funny creation: long-suffering, anti-media, and a proponent of fresh air, he also manages to get his revenge on his manic son by tying him up in mental knots with spurious bits of information . All these ingredients would, in the right hands, combine to make a perfectly good comic strip, but what always put Calvin and Hobbes ahead of the competition was the sheer artistry of Watterson's illustrations. In this regard, the chronological arrangement of the strips usefully shows Watterson's increasingly sophisticated technique, from his drawings of desert canyons and hideous inhabitants of alien planets, to the facial expressions of all his characters. It is hard to deny that Watterson owes a debt to Charles Schulz, whose Peanuts strip also offered a sophisticated yet deceptively simple evocation of the inner lives of children. For Calvin and Hobbes, however, Watterson combined uncanny ability, more than a touch of surrealism and a huge dose of humour to distil the essence of late-twentieth-century childhood, thereby elevating his strip into a league of its own.

This extraordinary graphic novel is so obviously a labour of love that the reader can only marvel at the energy that has been expended in its creation. Although the two plots that make up the book are essentially simple, the care with which Ware has executed them gives them an almost mythic quality. Jimmy Corrigan is a lonely, single, thirty-something with a boring job in an office cubicle, and a domineering mother who, in spite of living in a nursing home, is never far from the telephone or Jimmy. His crippling shyness renders him incapable of even saying hello to Peggy, the woman who works at an adjacent desk. When the father he has never known sends him an invitation and a plane ticket, Jimmy feels compelled to fly out to meet him. Jimmy's trip is mirrored by the boyhood tale of his grandfather, James, whose relationship with his father is tainted by unhappiness. Young James's mother has died, leaving his father with the unwanted job of bringing up the little boy alone, while at the same time maintaining his job as a glazier at the 1892 Chicago World's Fair. James is a frightened little boy, cowed by his father and bullied at school; he has a vagueness and fragility common to young, lonely and fearful children, qualities that are inherited generations later by his grandson. Chris Ware's illustrations are simply awe-inspiring in the true sense of the word. It is hard to believe that someone could put so much detail into each of the 380 pages that make up this incredible book, but there is a clue to his devotion in the afterword. After spending most of his life avoiding his own father, speaking only rarely on the phone, Ware finally met up with him: 'Gradually, the sublime outrageousness of our evening eroded into two people simply running out of things to say to each other. We weren't father and son anymore, just a pair of regretful men.'

Jennifer Niven's deeply compelling and highly successful first teen novel All The Bright Places was very much for an older audience with its themes of depression and suicide. Her new book Holding Up the Universe is suitable for younger teens as well - and just as powerfully written. The book is narrated in turns by Libby, famous for once being 'America's Fattest Teen' and starting high school after years of being home schooled, and Jack, who seems to be one of the popular kids but secretly suffers from Prospagnosia - the inability to recognise the faces of familiar people even those in this own family which is often called 'face blindness'. Their worlds collide in a horribly cruel high school game and an unlikely friendship is formed that leads to something even deeper. Jennifer Niven is a gorgeous writer. Her characters Libby and Jack feel so real that it's almost impossible to believe they don't live and breathe. The author herself struggled with weight issues and anxiety over the years, particularly as a teenager, so this writing comes from the heart. The spotlight on prosopagnosia sheds an interesting light on a little known but not so uncommon condition. The ultimate message is uplifting and positive and one that teenagers everywhere need to hear: be yourself and you deserve to be wanted and loved for who you are.Â

The huge achievement of the comic's creator Bill Watterson is celebrated here in this wonderful cloth-bound three-volume box set, which contains in chronological order every Calvin and Hobbes strip. For those who have never experienced the sheer delight of Watterson's creation, here is a brief summary: Calvin is an active and imaginative little boy; his friend Hobbes appears as a stuffed tiger when other people are around, but when the two of them are alone he comes to life and is Calvin's friend and playmate. They live with Calvin's long-suffering parents, who have to cope with his turbulent behaviour. The charm of the strip is multi-faceted. On the one hand, Calvin is a typical six-year-old with a vivid imagination: one minute he is fearless intergalactic traveller Spaceman Spiff, crash-landing on a hostile planet, the next he is a fearsome T-Rex stalking his victim through the Jurassic jungle. He is in thrall to consumerism, hates school, loves making gruesome snowmen, and plays Calvinball, an anarchic game of ever-changing rules. Yet he is also given to philosophising about the big issues of life, ably supported or gently undermined by Hobbes's quietly caustic asides . Here is an outlet for Watterson's deeply-held views about the craziness of the modern world; indeed, the artist himself has always shunned publicity. The strip is also enhanced by its strong cast of supporting characters. Mrs Wormwood the teacher looms over Calvin when he not paying attention; the school bully is always on hand to 'pound' him; Susie, the little girl from down the road, often gets her own back on her snowball-throwing nemesis. Calvin's dad is a particularly funny creation: long-suffering, anti-media, and a proponent of fresh air, he also manages to get his revenge on his manic son by tying him up in mental knots with spurious bits of information . All these ingredients would, in the right hands, combine to make a perfectly good comic strip, but what always put Calvin and Hobbes ahead of the competition was the sheer artistry of Watterson's illustrations. In this regard, the chronological arrangement of the strips usefully shows Watterson's increasingly sophisticated technique, from his drawings of desert canyons and hideous inhabitants of alien planets, to the facial expressions of all his characters. It is hard to deny that Watterson owes a debt to Charles Schulz, whose Peanuts strip also offered a sophisticated yet deceptively simple evocation of the inner lives of children. For Calvin and Hobbes, however, Watterson combined uncanny ability, more than a touch of surrealism and a huge dose of humour to distil the essence of late-twentieth-century childhood, thereby elevating his strip into a league of its own.

This extraordinary graphic novel is so obviously a labour of love that the reader can only marvel at the energy that has been expended in its creation. Although the two plots that make up the book are essentially simple, the care with which Ware has executed them gives them an almost mythic quality. Jimmy Corrigan is a lonely, single, thirty-something with a boring job in an office cubicle, and a domineering mother who, in spite of living in a nursing home, is never far from the telephone or Jimmy. His crippling shyness renders him incapable of even saying hello to Peggy, the woman who works at an adjacent desk. When the father he has never known sends him an invitation and a plane ticket, Jimmy feels compelled to fly out to meet him. Jimmy's trip is mirrored by the boyhood tale of his grandfather, James, whose relationship with his father is tainted by unhappiness. Young James's mother has died, leaving his father with the unwanted job of bringing up the little boy alone, while at the same time maintaining his job as a glazier at the 1892 Chicago World's Fair. James is a frightened little boy, cowed by his father and bullied at school; he has a vagueness and fragility common to young, lonely and fearful children, qualities that are inherited generations later by his grandson. Chris Ware's illustrations are simply awe-inspiring in the true sense of the word. It is hard to believe that someone could put so much detail into each of the 380 pages that make up this incredible book, but there is a clue to his devotion in the afterword. After spending most of his life avoiding his own father, speaking only rarely on the phone, Ware finally met up with him: 'Gradually, the sublime outrageousness of our evening eroded into two people simply running out of things to say to each other. We weren't father and son anymore, just a pair of regretful men.'

Kelly Barnhill won the Newbery Medal in the US for this thoughtful and magical book about belonging, fear and family, and itâs easy to see why.

Jennifer Niven's deeply compelling and highly successful first teen novel All The Bright Places was very much for an older audience with its themes of depression and suicide. Her new book Holding Up the Universe is suitable for younger teens as well - and just as powerfully written. The book is narrated in turns by Libby, famous for once being 'America's Fattest Teen' and starting high school after years of being home schooled, and Jack, who seems to be one of the popular kids but secretly suffers from Prospagnosia - the inability to recognise the faces of familiar people even those in this own family which is often called 'face blindness'. Their worlds collide in a horribly cruel high school game and an unlikely friendship is formed that leads to something even deeper. Jennifer Niven is a gorgeous writer. Her characters Libby and Jack feel so real that it's almost impossible to believe they don't live and breathe. The author herself struggled with weight issues and anxiety over the years, particularly as a teenager, so this writing comes from the heart. The spotlight on prosopagnosia sheds an interesting light on a little known but not so uncommon condition. The ultimate message is uplifting and positive and one that teenagers everywhere need to hear: be yourself and you deserve to be wanted and loved for who you are.Â

The comic-strip adventures of Calvin, a naughty boy with a philosophical bent, and his soft toy tiger companion Hobbes, delighted readers from 1985 to 1995. The huge achievement of the comic's creator Bill Watterson is celebrated here in this wonderful cloth-bound three-volume box set, which contains in chronological order every Calvin and Hobbes strip. For those who have never experienced the sheer delight of Watterson's creation, here is a brief summary: Calvin is an active and imaginative little boy; his friend Hobbes appears as a stuffed tiger when other people are around, but when the two of them are alone he comes to life and is Calvin's friend and playmate. They live with Calvin's long-suffering parents, who have to cope with his turbulent behaviour. The charm of the strip is multi-faceted. On the one hand, Calvin is a typical six-year-old with a vivid imagination: one minute he is fearless intergalactic traveller Spaceman Spiff, crash-landing on a hostile planet, the next he is a fearsome T-Rex stalking his victim through the Jurassic jungle. He is in thrall to consumerism, hates school, loves making gruesome snowmen, and plays Calvinball, an anarchic game of ever-changing rules. Yet he is also given to philosophising about the big issues of life, ably supported or gently undermined by Hobbes's quietly caustic asides . Here is an outlet for Watterson's deeply-held views about the craziness of the modern world; indeed, the artist himself has always shunned publicity. The strip is also enhanced by its strong cast of supporting characters. Mrs Wormwood the teacher looms over Calvin when he not paying attention; the school bully is always on hand to 'pound' him; Susie, the little girl from down the road, often gets her own back on her snowball-throwing nemesis. Calvin's dad is a particularly funny creation: long-suffering, anti-media, and a proponent of fresh air, he also manages to get his revenge on his manic son by tying him up in mental knots with spurious bits of information . All these ingredients would, in the right hands, combine to make a perfectly good comic strip, but what always put Calvin and Hobbes ahead of the competition was the sheer artistry of Watterson's illustrations. In this regard, the chronological arrangement of the strips usefully shows Watterson's increasingly sophisticated technique, from his drawings of desert canyons and hideous inhabitants of alien planets, to the facial expressions of all his characters. It is hard to deny that Watterson owes a debt to Charles Schulz, whose Peanuts strip also offered a sophisticated yet deceptively simple evocation of the inner lives of children. For Calvin and Hobbes, however, Watterson combined uncanny ability, more than a touch of surrealism and a huge dose of humour to distil the essence of late-twentieth-century childhood, thereby elevating his strip into a league of its own.

This extraordinary graphic novel is so obviously a labour of love that the reader can only marvel at the energy that has been expended in its creation. Although the two plots that make up the book are essentially simple, the care with which Ware has executed them gives them an almost mythic quality. Jimmy Corrigan is a lonely, single, thirty-something with a boring job in an office cubicle, and a domineering mother who, in spite of living in a nursing home, is never far from the telephone or Jimmy. His crippling shyness renders him incapable of even saying hello to Peggy, the woman who works at an adjacent desk. When the father he has never known sends him an invitation and a plane ticket, Jimmy feels compelled to fly out to meet him. Jimmy's trip is mirrored by the boyhood tale of his grandfather, James, whose relationship with his father is tainted by unhappiness. Young James's mother has died, leaving his father with the unwanted job of bringing up the little boy alone, while at the same time maintaining his job as a glazier at the 1892 Chicago World's Fair. James is a frightened little boy, cowed by his father and bullied at school; he has a vagueness and fragility common to young, lonely and fearful children, qualities that are inherited generations later by his grandson. Chris Ware's illustrations are simply awe-inspiring in the true sense of the word. It is hard to believe that someone could put so much detail into each of the 380 pages that make up this incredible book, but there is a clue to his devotion in the afterword. After spending most of his life avoiding his own father, speaking only rarely on the phone, Ware finally met up with him: 'Gradually, the sublime outrageousness of our evening eroded into two people simply running out of things to say to each other. We weren't father and son anymore, just a pair of regretful men.'

Jennifer Niven's deeply compelling and highly successful first teen novel All The Bright Places was very much for an older audience with its themes of depression and suicide. Her new book Holding Up the Universe is suitable for younger teens as well - and just as powerfully written. The book is narrated in turns by Libby, famous for once being 'America's Fattest Teen' and starting high school after years of being home schooled, and Jack, who seems to be one of the popular kids but secretly suffers from Prospagnosia - the inability to recognise the faces of familiar people even those in this own family which is often called 'face blindness'. Their worlds collide in a horribly cruel high school game and an unlikely friendship is formed that leads to something even deeper. Jennifer Niven is a gorgeous writer. Her characters Libby and Jack feel so real that it's almost impossible to believe they don't live and breathe. The author herself struggled with weight issues and anxiety over the years, particularly as a teenager, so this writing comes from the heart. The spotlight on prosopagnosia sheds an interesting light on a little known but not so uncommon condition. The ultimate message is uplifting and positive and one that teenagers everywhere need to hear: be yourself and you deserve to be wanted and loved for who you are.Â

The comic-strip adventures of Calvin, a naughty boy with a philosophical bent, and his soft toy tiger companion Hobbes, delighted readers from 1985 to 1995. The huge achievement of the comic's creator Bill Watterson is celebrated here in this wonderful cloth-bound three-volume box set, which contains in chronological order every Calvin and Hobbes strip. For those who have never experienced the sheer delight of Watterson's creation, here is a brief summary: Calvin is an active and imaginative little boy; his friend Hobbes appears as a stuffed tiger when other people are around, but when the two of them are alone he comes to life and is Calvin's friend and playmate. They live with Calvin's long-suffering parents, who have to cope with his turbulent behaviour. The charm of the strip is multi-faceted. On the one hand, Calvin is a typical six-year-old with a vivid imagination: one minute he is fearless intergalactic traveller Spaceman Spiff, crash-landing on a hostile planet, the next he is a fearsome T-Rex stalking his victim through the Jurassic jungle. He is in thrall to consumerism, hates school, loves making gruesome snowmen, and plays Calvinball, an anarchic game of ever-changing rules. Yet he is also given to philosophising about the big issues of life, ably supported or gently undermined by Hobbes's quietly caustic asides . Here is an outlet for Watterson's deeply-held views about the craziness of the modern world; indeed, the artist himself has always shunned publicity. The strip is also enhanced by its strong cast of supporting characters. Mrs Wormwood the teacher looms over Calvin when he not paying attention; the school bully is always on hand to 'pound' him; Susie, the little girl from down the road, often gets her own back on her snowball-throwing nemesis. Calvin's dad is a particularly funny creation: long-suffering, anti-media, and a proponent of fresh air, he also manages to get his revenge on his manic son by tying him up in mental knots with spurious bits of information . All these ingredients would, in the right hands, combine to make a perfectly good comic strip, but what always put Calvin and Hobbes ahead of the competition was the sheer artistry of Watterson's illustrations. In this regard, the chronological arrangement of the strips usefully shows Watterson's increasingly sophisticated technique, from his drawings of desert canyons and hideous inhabitants of alien planets, to the facial expressions of all his characters. It is hard to deny that Watterson owes a debt to Charles Schulz, whose Peanuts strip also offered a sophisticated yet deceptively simple evocation of the inner lives of children. For Calvin and Hobbes, however, Watterson combined uncanny ability, more than a touch of surrealism and a huge dose of humour to distil the essence of late-twentieth-century childhood, thereby elevating his strip into a league of its own.

This extraordinary graphic novel is so obviously a labour of love that the reader can only marvel at the energy that has been expended in its creation. Although the two plots that make up the book are essentially simple, the care with which Ware has executed them gives them an almost mythic quality. Jimmy Corrigan is a lonely, single, thirty-something with a boring job in an office cubicle, and a domineering mother who, in spite of living in a nursing home, is never far from the telephone or Jimmy. His crippling shyness renders him incapable of even saying hello to Peggy, the woman who works at an adjacent desk. When the father he has never known sends him an invitation and a plane ticket, Jimmy feels compelled to fly out to meet him. Jimmy's trip is mirrored by the boyhood tale of his grandfather, James, whose relationship with his father is tainted by unhappiness. Young James's mother has died, leaving his father with the unwanted job of bringing up the little boy alone, while at the same time maintaining his job as a glazier at the 1892 Chicago World's Fair. James is a frightened little boy, cowed by his father and bullied at school; he has a vagueness and fragility common to young, lonely and fearful children, qualities that are inherited generations later by his grandson. Chris Ware's illustrations are simply awe-inspiring in the true sense of the word. It is hard to believe that someone could put so much detail into each of the 380 pages that make up this incredible book, but there is a clue to his devotion in the afterword. After spending most of his life avoiding his own father, speaking only rarely on the phone, Ware finally met up with him: 'Gradually, the sublime outrageousness of our evening eroded into two people simply running out of things to say to each other. We weren't father and son anymore, just a pair of regretful men.'

Jennifer Niven's deeply compelling and highly successful first teen novel All The Bright Places was very much for an older audience with its themes of depression and suicide. Her new book Holding Up the Universe is suitable for younger teens as well - and just as powerfully written. The book is narrated in turns by Libby, famous for once being 'America's Fattest Teen' and starting high school after years of being home schooled, and Jack, who seems to be one of the popular kids but secretly suffers from Prospagnosia - the inability to recognise the faces of familiar people even those in this own family which is often called 'face blindness'. Their worlds collide in a horribly cruel high school game and an unlikely friendship is formed that leads to something even deeper. Jennifer Niven is a gorgeous writer. Her characters Libby and Jack feel so real that it's almost impossible to believe they don't live and breathe. The author herself struggled with weight issues and anxiety over the years, particularly as a teenager, so this writing comes from the heart. The spotlight on prosopagnosia sheds an interesting light on a little known but not so uncommon condition. The ultimate message is uplifting and positive and one that teenagers everywhere need to hear: be yourself and you deserve to be wanted and loved for who you are.Â

The comic-strip adventures of Calvin, a naughty boy with a philosophical bent, and his soft toy tiger companion Hobbes, delighted readers from 1985 to 1995. The huge achievement of the comic's creator Bill Watterson is celebrated here in this wonderful cloth-bound three-volume box set, which contains in chronological order every Calvin and Hobbes strip. For those who have never experienced the sheer delight of Watterson's creation, here is a brief summary: Calvin is an active and imaginative little boy; his friend Hobbes appears as a stuffed tiger when other people are around, but when the two of them are alone he comes to life and is Calvin's friend and playmate. They live with Calvin's long-suffering parents, who have to cope with his turbulent behaviour. The charm of the strip is multi-faceted. On the one hand, Calvin is a typical six-year-old with a vivid imagination: one minute he is fearless intergalactic traveller Spaceman Spiff, crash-landing on a hostile planet, the next he is a fearsome T-Rex stalking his victim through the Jurassic jungle. He is in thrall to consumerism, hates school, loves making gruesome snowmen, and plays Calvinball, an anarchic game of ever-changing rules. Yet he is also given to philosophising about the big issues of life, ably supported or gently undermined by Hobbes's quietly caustic asides . Here is an outlet for Watterson's deeply-held views about the craziness of the modern world; indeed, the artist himself has always shunned publicity. The strip is also enhanced by its strong cast of supporting characters. Mrs Wormwood the teacher looms over Calvin when he not paying attention; the school bully is always on hand to 'pound' him; Susie, the little girl from down the road, often gets her own back on her snowball-throwing nemesis. Calvin's dad is a particularly funny creation: long-suffering, anti-media, and a proponent of fresh air, he also manages to get his revenge on his manic son by tying him up in mental knots with spurious bits of information . All these ingredients would, in the right hands, combine to make a perfectly good comic strip, but what always put Calvin and Hobbes ahead of the competition was the sheer artistry of Watterson's illustrations. In this regard, the chronological arrangement of the strips usefully shows Watterson's increasingly sophisticated technique, from his drawings of desert canyons and hideous inhabitants of alien planets, to the facial expressions of all his characters. It is hard to deny that Watterson owes a debt to Charles Schulz, whose Peanuts strip also offered a sophisticated yet deceptively simple evocation of the inner lives of children. For Calvin and Hobbes, however, Watterson combined uncanny ability, more than a touch of surrealism and a huge dose of humour to distil the essence of late-twentieth-century childhood, thereby elevating his strip into a league of its own.

This extraordinary graphic novel is so obviously a labour of love that the reader can only marvel at the energy that has been expended in its creation. Although the two plots that make up the book are essentially simple, the care with which Ware has executed them gives them an almost mythic quality. Jimmy Corrigan is a lonely, single, thirty-something with a boring job in an office cubicle, and a domineering mother who, in spite of living in a nursing home, is never far from the telephone or Jimmy. His crippling shyness renders him incapable of even saying hello to Peggy, the woman who works at an adjacent desk. When the father he has never known sends him an invitation and a plane ticket, Jimmy feels compelled to fly out to meet him. Jimmy's trip is mirrored by the boyhood tale of his grandfather, James, whose relationship with his father is tainted by unhappiness. Young James's mother has died, leaving his father with the unwanted job of bringing up the little boy alone, while at the same time maintaining his job as a glazier at the 1892 Chicago World's Fair. James is a frightened little boy, cowed by his father and bullied at school; he has a vagueness and fragility common to young, lonely and fearful children, qualities that are inherited generations later by his grandson. Chris Ware's illustrations are simply awe-inspiring in the true sense of the word. It is hard to believe that someone could put so much detail into each of the 380 pages that make up this incredible book, but there is a clue to his devotion in the afterword. After spending most of his life avoiding his own father, speaking only rarely on the phone, Ware finally met up with him: 'Gradually, the sublime outrageousness of our evening eroded into two people simply running out of things to say to each other. We weren't father and son anymore, just a pair of regretful men.'

The comic-strip adventures of Calvin, a naughty boy with a philosophical bent, and his soft toy tiger companion Hobbes, delighted readers from 1985 to 1995. The huge achievement of the comic's creator Bill Watterson is celebrated here in this wonderful cloth-bound three-volume box set, which contains in chronological order every Calvin and Hobbes strip. For those who have never experienced the sheer delight of Watterson's creation, here is a brief summary: Calvin is an active and imaginative little boy; his friend Hobbes appears as a stuffed tiger when other people are around, but when the two of them are alone he comes to life and is Calvin's friend and playmate. They live with Calvin's long-suffering parents, who have to cope with his turbulent behaviour. The charm of the strip is multi-faceted. On the one hand, Calvin is a typical six-year-old with a vivid imagination: one minute he is fearless intergalactic traveller Spaceman Spiff, crash-landing on a hostile planet, the next he is a fearsome T-Rex stalking his victim through the Jurassic jungle. He is in thrall to consumerism, hates school, loves making gruesome snowmen, and plays Calvinball, an anarchic game of ever-changing rules. Yet he is also given to philosophising about the big issues of life, ably supported or gently undermined by Hobbes's quietly caustic asides . Here is an outlet for Watterson's deeply-held views about the craziness of the modern world; indeed, the artist himself has always shunned publicity. The strip is also enhanced by its strong cast of supporting characters. Mrs Wormwood the teacher looms over Calvin when he not paying attention; the school bully is always on hand to 'pound' him; Susie, the little girl from down the road, often gets her own back on her snowball-throwing nemesis. Calvin's dad is a particularly funny creation: long-suffering, anti-media, and a proponent of fresh air, he also manages to get his revenge on his manic son by tying him up in mental knots with spurious bits of information . All these ingredients would, in the right hands, combine to make a perfectly good comic strip, but what always put Calvin and Hobbes ahead of the competition was the sheer artistry of Watterson's illustrations. In this regard, the chronological arrangement of the strips usefully shows Watterson's increasingly sophisticated technique, from his drawings of desert canyons and hideous inhabitants of alien planets, to the facial expressions of all his characters. It is hard to deny that Watterson owes a debt to Charles Schulz, whose Peanuts strip also offered a sophisticated yet deceptively simple evocation of the inner lives of children. For Calvin and Hobbes, however, Watterson combined uncanny ability, more than a touch of surrealism and a huge dose of humour to distil the essence of late-twentieth-century childhood, thereby elevating his strip into a league of its own.

This extraordinary graphic novel is so obviously a labour of love that the reader can only marvel at the energy that has been expended in its creation. Although the two plots that make up the book are essentially simple, the care with which Ware has executed them gives them an almost mythic quality. Jimmy Corrigan is a lonely, single, thirty-something with a boring job in an office cubicle, and a domineering mother who, in spite of living in a nursing home, is never far from the telephone or Jimmy. His crippling shyness renders him incapable of even saying hello to Peggy, the woman who works at an adjacent desk. When the father he has never known sends him an invitation and a plane ticket, Jimmy feels compelled to fly out to meet him. Jimmy's trip is mirrored by the boyhood tale of his grandfather, James, whose relationship with his father is tainted by unhappiness. Young James's mother has died, leaving his father with the unwanted job of bringing up the little boy alone, while at the same time maintaining his job as a glazier at the 1892 Chicago World's Fair. James is a frightened little boy, cowed by his father and bullied at school; he has a vagueness and fragility common to young, lonely and fearful children, qualities that are inherited generations later by his grandson. Chris Ware's illustrations are simply awe-inspiring in the true sense of the word. It is hard to believe that someone could put so much detail into each of the 380 pages that make up this incredible book, but there is a clue to his devotion in the afterword. After spending most of his life avoiding his own father, speaking only rarely on the phone, Ware finally met up with him: 'Gradually, the sublime outrageousness of our evening eroded into two people simply running out of things to say to each other. We weren't father and son anymore, just a pair of regretful men.'

Kelly Barnhill won the Newbery Medal in the US for this thoughtful and magical book about belonging, fear and family, and itâs easy to see why.

Jennifer Niven's deeply compelling and highly successful first teen novel All The Bright Places was very much for an older audience with its themes of depression and suicide. Her new book Holding Up the Universe is suitable for younger teens as well - and just as powerfully written. The book is narrated in turns by Libby, famous for once being 'America's Fattest Teen' and starting high school after years of being home schooled, and Jack, who seems to be one of the popular kids but secretly suffers from Prospagnosia - the inability to recognise the faces of familiar people even those in this own family which is often called 'face blindness'. Their worlds collide in a horribly cruel high school game and an unlikely friendship is formed that leads to something even deeper. Jennifer Niven is a gorgeous writer. Her characters Libby and Jack feel so real that it's almost impossible to believe they don't live and breathe. The author herself struggled with weight issues and anxiety over the years, particularly as a teenager, so this writing comes from the heart. The spotlight on prosopagnosia sheds an interesting light on a little known but not so uncommon condition. The ultimate message is uplifting and positive and one that teenagers everywhere need to hear: be yourself and you deserve to be wanted and loved for who you are.Â

The comic-strip adventures of Calvin, a naughty boy with a philosophical bent, and his soft toy tiger companion Hobbes, delighted readers from 1985 to 1995. The huge achievement of the comic's creator Bill Watterson is celebrated here in this wonderful cloth-bound three-volume box set, which contains in chronological order every Calvin and Hobbes strip. For those who have never experienced the sheer delight of Watterson's creation, here is a brief summary: Calvin is an active and imaginative little boy; his friend Hobbes appears as a stuffed tiger when other people are around, but when the two of them are alone he comes to life and is Calvin's friend and playmate. They live with Calvin's long-suffering parents, who have to cope with his turbulent behaviour. The charm of the strip is multi-faceted. On the one hand, Calvin is a typical six-year-old with a vivid imagination: one minute he is fearless intergalactic traveller Spaceman Spiff, crash-landing on a hostile planet, the next he is a fearsome T-Rex stalking his victim through the Jurassic jungle. He is in thrall to consumerism, hates school, loves making gruesome snowmen, and plays Calvinball, an anarchic game of ever-changing rules. Yet he is also given to philosophising about the big issues of life, ably supported or gently undermined by Hobbes's quietly caustic asides . Here is an outlet for Watterson's deeply-held views about the craziness of the modern world; indeed, the artist himself has always shunned publicity. The strip is also enhanced by its strong cast of supporting characters. Mrs Wormwood the teacher looms over Calvin when he not paying attention; the school bully is always on hand to 'pound' him; Susie, the little girl from down the road, often gets her own back on her snowball-throwing nemesis. Calvin's dad is a particularly funny creation: long-suffering, anti-media, and a proponent of fresh air, he also manages to get his revenge on his manic son by tying him up in mental knots with spurious bits of information . All these ingredients would, in the right hands, combine to make a perfectly good comic strip, but what always put Calvin and Hobbes ahead of the competition was the sheer artistry of Watterson's illustrations. In this regard, the chronological arrangement of the strips usefully shows Watterson's increasingly sophisticated technique, from his drawings of desert canyons and hideous inhabitants of alien planets, to the facial expressions of all his characters. It is hard to deny that Watterson owes a debt to Charles Schulz, whose Peanuts strip also offered a sophisticated yet deceptively simple evocation of the inner lives of children. For Calvin and Hobbes, however, Watterson combined uncanny ability, more than a touch of surrealism and a huge dose of humour to distil the essence of late-twentieth-century childhood, thereby elevating his strip into a league of its own.

This extraordinary graphic novel is so obviously a labour of love that the reader can only marvel at the energy that has been expended in its creation. Although the two plots that make up the book are essentially simple, the care with which Ware has executed them gives them an almost mythic quality. Jimmy Corrigan is a lonely, single, thirty-something with a boring job in an office cubicle, and a domineering mother who, in spite of living in a nursing home, is never far from the telephone or Jimmy. His crippling shyness renders him incapable of even saying hello to Peggy, the woman who works at an adjacent desk. When the father he has never known sends him an invitation and a plane ticket, Jimmy feels compelled to fly out to meet him. Jimmy's trip is mirrored by the boyhood tale of his grandfather, James, whose relationship with his father is tainted by unhappiness. Young James's mother has died, leaving his father with the unwanted job of bringing up the little boy alone, while at the same time maintaining his job as a glazier at the 1892 Chicago World's Fair. James is a frightened little boy, cowed by his father and bullied at school; he has a vagueness and fragility common to young, lonely and fearful children, qualities that are inherited generations later by his grandson. Chris Ware's illustrations are simply awe-inspiring in the true sense of the word. It is hard to believe that someone could put so much detail into each of the 380 pages that make up this incredible book, but there is a clue to his devotion in the afterword. After spending most of his life avoiding his own father, speaking only rarely on the phone, Ware finally met up with him: 'Gradually, the sublime outrageousness of our evening eroded into two people simply running out of things to say to each other. We weren't father and son anymore, just a pair of regretful men.'

Jennifer Niven's deeply compelling and highly successful first teen novel All The Bright Places was very much for an older audience with its themes of depression and suicide. Her new book Holding Up the Universe is suitable for younger teens as well - and just as powerfully written. The book is narrated in turns by Libby, famous for once being 'America's Fattest Teen' and starting high school after years of being home schooled, and Jack, who seems to be one of the popular kids but secretly suffers from Prospagnosia - the inability to recognise the faces of familiar people even those in this own family which is often called 'face blindness'. Their worlds collide in a horribly cruel high school game and an unlikely friendship is formed that leads to something even deeper. Jennifer Niven is a gorgeous writer. Her characters Libby and Jack feel so real that it's almost impossible to believe they don't live and breathe. The author herself struggled with weight issues and anxiety over the years, particularly as a teenager, so this writing comes from the heart. The spotlight on prosopagnosia sheds an interesting light on a little known but not so uncommon condition. The ultimate message is uplifting and positive and one that teenagers everywhere need to hear: be yourself and you deserve to be wanted and loved for who you are.Â

The comic-strip adventures of Calvin, a naughty boy with a philosophical bent, and his soft toy tiger companion Hobbes, delighted readers from 1985 to 1995. The huge achievement of the comic's creator Bill Watterson is celebrated here in this wonderful cloth-bound three-volume box set, which contains in chronological order every Calvin and Hobbes strip. For those who have never experienced the sheer delight of Watterson's creation, here is a brief summary: Calvin is an active and imaginative little boy; his friend Hobbes appears as a stuffed tiger when other people are around, but when the two of them are alone he comes to life and is Calvin's friend and playmate. They live with Calvin's long-suffering parents, who have to cope with his turbulent behaviour. The charm of the strip is multi-faceted. On the one hand, Calvin is a typical six-year-old with a vivid imagination: one minute he is fearless intergalactic traveller Spaceman Spiff, crash-landing on a hostile planet, the next he is a fearsome T-Rex stalking his victim through the Jurassic jungle. He is in thrall to consumerism, hates school, loves making gruesome snowmen, and plays Calvinball, an anarchic game of ever-changing rules. Yet he is also given to philosophising about the big issues of life, ably supported or gently undermined by Hobbes's quietly caustic asides . Here is an outlet for Watterson's deeply-held views about the craziness of the modern world; indeed, the artist himself has always shunned publicity. The strip is also enhanced by its strong cast of supporting characters. Mrs Wormwood the teacher looms over Calvin when he not paying attention; the school bully is always on hand to 'pound' him; Susie, the little girl from down the road, often gets her own back on her snowball-throwing nemesis. Calvin's dad is a particularly funny creation: long-suffering, anti-media, and a proponent of fresh air, he also manages to get his revenge on his manic son by tying him up in mental knots with spurious bits of information . All these ingredients would, in the right hands, combine to make a perfectly good comic strip, but what always put Calvin and Hobbes ahead of the competition was the sheer artistry of Watterson's illustrations. In this regard, the chronological arrangement of the strips usefully shows Watterson's increasingly sophisticated technique, from his drawings of desert canyons and hideous inhabitants of alien planets, to the facial expressions of all his characters. It is hard to deny that Watterson owes a debt to Charles Schulz, whose Peanuts strip also offered a sophisticated yet deceptively simple evocation of the inner lives of children. For Calvin and Hobbes, however, Watterson combined uncanny ability, more than a touch of surrealism and a huge dose of humour to distil the essence of late-twentieth-century childhood, thereby elevating his strip into a league of its own.

On the eve of battle, Sir Thomas Lemuel Hawke of Cornwall writes a letter to his children. It is a guide on how to live well, like a knight: staying wise, humble, courageous, loving and kind.

So when an inexplicable glitch in his final examination ends his hopes at a single stroke, he has no choice but to take up the less-than-legal offer of captaining the Invictus through time and space. What he doesnât realise is that the glitch was planned. Someone is playing him â someone who is a lot closer to him than he could ever have imagined. What is at stake is more than his career, more than his mother, and even more than his life. Graudin weaves an exciting plot where time travel is just the beginning. Her characters are spunky, smart-mouthed, tormented, emotionally yearning and contemporary. Itâs Firefly meets Assassinâs Creed, but Graudin has a way with words that gives the book depth and makes it more than just an enjoyable page-turner.

This extraordinary graphic novel is so obviously a labour of love that the reader can only marvel at the energy that has been expended in its creation. Although the two plots that make up the book are essentially simple, the care with which Ware has executed them gives them an almost mythic quality. Jimmy Corrigan is a lonely, single, thirty-something with a boring job in an office cubicle, and a domineering mother who, in spite of living in a nursing home, is never far from the telephone or Jimmy. His crippling shyness renders him incapable of even saying hello to Peggy, the woman who works at an adjacent desk. When the father he has never known sends him an invitation and a plane ticket, Jimmy feels compelled to fly out to meet him. Jimmy's trip is mirrored by the boyhood tale of his grandfather, James, whose relationship with his father is tainted by unhappiness. Young James's mother has died, leaving his father with the unwanted job of bringing up the little boy alone, while at the same time maintaining his job as a glazier at the 1892 Chicago World's Fair. James is a frightened little boy, cowed by his father and bullied at school; he has a vagueness and fragility common to young, lonely and fearful children, qualities that are inherited generations later by his grandson. Chris Ware's illustrations are simply awe-inspiring in the true sense of the word. It is hard to believe that someone could put so much detail into each of the 380 pages that make up this incredible book, but there is a clue to his devotion in the afterword. After spending most of his life avoiding his own father, speaking only rarely on the phone, Ware finally met up with him: 'Gradually, the sublime outrageousness of our evening eroded into two people simply running out of things to say to each other. We weren't father and son anymore, just a pair of regretful men.'

Every year, the evil Protectorate offers a baby to the evil witch in the forest to ensure their villageâs safety. Yet, unknown to them, the witch is Xan, the plump and knowledgeable protector of the babies that she takes to the neighbouring village to be raised as special children, fed on starlight and destined to do wonderful things.

But nothing is straightforward, and when Luna turns 13, everything will change. Kelly Barnhill won the Newbery Medal in the US for this thoughtful and magical book about belonging, fear and family, and itâs easy to see why.

Xan is a delightfully pleasant and caring crone witch who dispels the traditional image of cackling evildoer, and replaces it with something far more loving and magical.

Jennifer Niven's deeply compelling and highly successful first teen novel All The Bright Places was very much for an older audience with its themes of depression and suicide. Her new book Holding Up the Universe is suitable for younger teens as well - and just as powerfully written. The book is narrated in turns by Libby, famous for once being 'America's Fattest Teen' and starting high school after years of being home schooled, and Jack, who seems to be one of the popular kids but secretly suffers from Prospagnosia - the inability to recognise the faces of familiar people even those in this own family which is often called 'face blindness'. Their worlds collide in a horribly cruel high school game and an unlikely friendship is formed that leads to something even deeper. Jennifer Niven is a gorgeous writer. Her characters Libby and Jack feel so real that it's almost impossible to believe they don't live and breathe. The author herself struggled with weight issues and anxiety over the years, particularly as a teenager, so this writing comes from the heart. The spotlight on prosopagnosia sheds an interesting light on a little known but not so uncommon condition. The ultimate message is uplifting and positive and one that teenagers everywhere need to hear: be yourself and you deserve to be wanted and loved for who you are.Â

The comic-strip adventures of Calvin, a naughty boy with a philosophical bent, and his soft toy tiger companion Hobbes, delighted readers from 1985 to 1995. The huge achievement of the comic's creator Bill Watterson is celebrated here in this wonderful cloth-bound three-volume box set, which contains in chronological order every Calvin and Hobbes strip. For those who have never experienced the sheer delight of Watterson's creation, here is a brief summary: Calvin is an active and imaginative little boy; his friend Hobbes appears as a stuffed tiger when other people are around, but when the two of them are alone he comes to life and is Calvin's friend and playmate. They live with Calvin's long-suffering parents, who have to cope with his turbulent behaviour. The charm of the strip is multi-faceted. On the one hand, Calvin is a typical six-year-old with a vivid imagination: one minute he is fearless intergalactic traveller Spaceman Spiff, crash-landing on a hostile planet, the next he is a fearsome T-Rex stalking his victim through the Jurassic jungle. He is in thrall to consumerism, hates school, loves making gruesome snowmen, and plays Calvinball, an anarchic game of ever-changing rules. Yet he is also given to philosophising about the big issues of life, ably supported or gently undermined by Hobbes's quietly caustic asides . Here is an outlet for Watterson's deeply-held views about the craziness of the modern world; indeed, the artist himself has always shunned publicity. The strip is also enhanced by its strong cast of supporting characters. Mrs Wormwood the teacher looms over Calvin when he not paying attention; the school bully is always on hand to 'pound' him; Susie, the little girl from down the road, often gets her own back on her snowball-throwing nemesis. Calvin's dad is a particularly funny creation: long-suffering, anti-media, and a proponent of fresh air, he also manages to get his revenge on his manic son by tying him up in mental knots with spurious bits of information . All these ingredients would, in the right hands, combine to make a perfectly good comic strip, but what always put Calvin and Hobbes ahead of the competition was the sheer artistry of Watterson's illustrations. In this regard, the chronological arrangement of the strips usefully shows Watterson's increasingly sophisticated technique, from his drawings of desert canyons and hideous inhabitants of alien planets, to the facial expressions of all his characters. It is hard to deny that Watterson owes a debt to Charles Schulz, whose Peanuts strip also offered a sophisticated yet deceptively simple evocation of the inner lives of children. For Calvin and Hobbes, however, Watterson combined uncanny ability, more than a touch of surrealism and a huge dose of humour to distil the essence of late-twentieth-century childhood, thereby elevating his strip into a league of its own.

On the eve of battle, Sir Thomas Lemuel Hawke of Cornwall writes a letter to his children. It is a guide on how to live well, like a knight: staying wise, humble, courageous, loving and kind. Hawke has tried to make this book look as authentic as possible. The cover stands out with a gold-embossed leaf. Inside, an editorâs note talks about the discovery of the âhistoricalâ letter, confirming Sir Thomas's death at the Battle of Slaughter Bridge in 1483.It all gives the book an important and timeless feel.

This extraordinary graphic novel is so obviously a labour of love that the reader can only marvel at the energy that has been expended in its creation. Although the two plots that make up the book are essentially simple, the care with which Ware has executed them gives them an almost mythic quality. Jimmy Corrigan is a lonely, single, thirty-something with a boring job in an office cubicle, and a domineering mother who, in spite of living in a nursing home, is never far from the telephone or Jimmy. His crippling shyness renders him incapable of even saying hello to Peggy, the woman who works at an adjacent desk. When the father he has never known sends him an invitation and a plane ticket, Jimmy feels compelled to fly out to meet him. Jimmy's trip is mirrored by the boyhood tale of his grandfather, James, whose relationship with his father is tainted by unhappiness. Young James's mother has died, leaving his father with the unwanted job of bringing up the little boy alone, while at the same time maintaining his job as a glazier at the 1892 Chicago World's Fair. James is a frightened little boy, cowed by his father and bullied at school; he has a vagueness and fragility common to young, lonely and fearful children, qualities that are inherited generations later by his grandson. Chris Ware's illustrations are simply awe-inspiring in the true sense of the word. It is hard to believe that someone could put so much detail into each of the 380 pages that make up this incredible book, but there is a clue to his devotion in the afterword. After spending most of his life avoiding his own father, speaking only rarely on the phone, Ware finally met up with him: 'Gradually, the sublime outrageousness of our evening eroded into two people simply running out of things to say to each other. We weren't father and son anymore, just a pair of regretful men.'

Every year, the evil Protectorate offers a baby to the evil witch in the forest to ensure their villageâs safety. Yet, unknown to them, the witch is Xan, the plump and knowledgeable protector of the babies that she takes to the neighbouring village to be raised as special children, fed on starlight and destined to do wonderful things.

Jennifer Niven's deeply compelling and highly successful first teen novel All The Bright Places was very much for an older audience with its themes of depression and suicide. Her new book Holding Up the Universe is suitable for younger teens as well - and just as powerfully written. The book is narrated in turns by Libby, famous for once being 'America's Fattest Teen' and starting high school after years of being home schooled, and Jack, who seems to be one of the popular kids but secretly suffers from Prospagnosia - the inability to recognise the faces of familiar people even those in this own family which is often called 'face blindness'. Their worlds collide in a horribly cruel high school game and an unlikely friendship is formed that leads to something even deeper. Jennifer Niven is a gorgeous writer. Her characters Libby and Jack feel so real that it's almost impossible to believe they don't live and breathe. The author herself struggled with weight issues and anxiety over the years, particularly as a teenager, so this writing comes from the heart. The spotlight on prosopagnosia sheds an interesting light on a little known but not so uncommon condition. The ultimate message is uplifting and positive and one that teenagers everywhere need to hear: be yourself and you deserve to be wanted and loved for who you are.Â

The comic-strip adventures of Calvin, a naughty boy with a philosophical bent, and his soft toy tiger companion Hobbes, delighted readers from 1985 to 1995. The huge achievement of the comic's creator Bill Watterson is celebrated here in this wonderful cloth-bound three-volume box set, which contains in chronological order every Calvin and Hobbes strip. For those who have never experienced the sheer delight of Watterson's creation, here is a brief summary: Calvin is an active and imaginative little boy; his friend Hobbes appears as a stuffed tiger when other people are around, but when the two of them are alone he comes to life and is Calvin's friend and playmate. They live with Calvin's long-suffering parents, who have to cope with his turbulent behaviour. The charm of the strip is multi-faceted. On the one hand, Calvin is a typical six-year-old with a vivid imagination: one minute he is fearless intergalactic traveller Spaceman Spiff, crash-landing on a hostile planet, the next he is a fearsome T-Rex stalking his victim through the Jurassic jungle. He is in thrall to consumerism, hates school, loves making gruesome snowmen, and plays Calvinball, an anarchic game of ever-changing rules. Yet he is also given to philosophising about the big issues of life, ably supported or gently undermined by Hobbes's quietly caustic asides . Here is an outlet for Watterson's deeply-held views about the craziness of the modern world; indeed, the artist himself has always shunned publicity. The strip is also enhanced by its strong cast of supporting characters. Mrs Wormwood the teacher looms over Calvin when he not paying attention; the school bully is always on hand to 'pound' him; Susie, the little girl from down the road, often gets her own back on her snowball-throwing nemesis. Calvin's dad is a particularly funny creation: long-suffering, anti-media, and a proponent of fresh air, he also manages to get his revenge on his manic son by tying him up in mental knots with spurious bits of information . All these ingredients would, in the right hands, combine to make a perfectly good comic strip, but what always put Calvin and Hobbes ahead of the competition was the sheer artistry of Watterson's illustrations. In this regard, the chronological arrangement of the strips usefully shows Watterson's increasingly sophisticated technique, from his drawings of desert canyons and hideous inhabitants of alien planets, to the facial expressions of all his characters. It is hard to deny that Watterson owes a debt to Charles Schulz, whose Peanuts strip also offered a sophisticated yet deceptively simple evocation of the inner lives of children. For Calvin and Hobbes, however, Watterson combined uncanny ability, more than a touch of surrealism and a huge dose of humour to distil the essence of late-twentieth-century childhood, thereby elevating his strip into a league of its own.

On the eve of battle, Sir Thomas Lemuel Hawke of Cornwall writes a letter to his children. It is a guide on how to live well, like a knight: staying wise, humble, courageous, loving and kind. Hawke has tried to make this book look as authentic as possible. The cover stands out with a gold-embossed leaf. Inside, an editorâs note talks about the discovery of the âhistoricalâ letter, confirming Sir Thomas's death at the Battle of Slaughter Bridge in 1483.It all gives the book an important and timeless feel.

This extraordinary graphic novel is so obviously a labour of love that the reader can only marvel at the energy that has been expended in its creation. Although the two plots that make up the book are essentially simple, the care with which Ware has executed them gives them an almost mythic quality. Jimmy Corrigan is a lonely, single, thirty-something with a boring job in an office cubicle, and a domineering mother who, in spite of living in a nursing home, is never far from the telephone or Jimmy. His crippling shyness renders him incapable of even saying hello to Peggy, the woman who works at an adjacent desk. When the father he has never known sends him an invitation and a plane ticket, Jimmy feels compelled to fly out to meet him. Jimmy's trip is mirrored by the boyhood tale of his grandfather, James, whose relationship with his father is tainted by unhappiness. Young James's mother has died, leaving his father with the unwanted job of bringing up the little boy alone, while at the same time maintaining his job as a glazier at the 1892 Chicago World's Fair. James is a frightened little boy, cowed by his father and bullied at school; he has a vagueness and fragility common to young, lonely and fearful children, qualities that are inherited generations later by his grandson. Chris Ware's illustrations are simply awe-inspiring in the true sense of the word. It is hard to believe that someone could put so much detail into each of the 380 pages that make up this incredible book, but there is a clue to his devotion in the afterword. After spending most of his life avoiding his own father, speaking only rarely on the phone, Ware finally met up with him: 'Gradually, the sublime outrageousness of our evening eroded into two people simply running out of things to say to each other. We weren't father and son anymore, just a pair of regretful men.'

Every year, the evil Protectorate offers a baby to the evil witch in the forest to ensure their villageâs safety. Yet, unknown to them, the witch is Xan, the plump and knowledgeable protector of the babies that she takes to the neighbouring village to be raised as special children, fed on starlight and destined to do wonderful things.

Jennifer Niven's deeply compelling and highly successful first teen novel All The Bright Places was very much for an older audience with its themes of depression and suicide. Her new book Holding Up the Universe is suitable for younger teens as well - and just as powerfully written. The book is narrated in turns by Libby, famous for once being 'America's Fattest Teen' and starting high school after years of being home schooled, and Jack, who seems to be one of the popular kids but secretly suffers from Prospagnosia - the inability to recognise the faces of familiar people even those in this own family which is often called 'face blindness'. Their worlds collide in a horribly cruel high school game and an unlikely friendship is formed that leads to something even deeper. Jennifer Niven is a gorgeous writer. Her characters Libby and Jack feel so real that it's almost impossible to believe they don't live and breathe. The author herself struggled with weight issues and anxiety over the years, particularly as a teenager, so this writing comes from the heart. The spotlight on prosopagnosia sheds an interesting light on a little known but not so uncommon condition. The ultimate message is uplifting and positive and one that teenagers everywhere need to hear: be yourself and you deserve to be wanted and loved for who you are.Â

The comic-strip adventures of Calvin, a naughty boy with a philosophical bent, and his soft toy tiger companion Hobbes, delighted readers from 1985 to 1995. The huge achievement of the comic's creator Bill Watterson is celebrated here in this wonderful cloth-bound three-volume box set, which contains in chronological order every Calvin and Hobbes strip. For those who have never experienced the sheer delight of Watterson's creation, here is a brief summary: Calvin is an active and imaginative little boy; his friend Hobbes appears as a stuffed tiger when other people are around, but when the two of them are alone he comes to life and is Calvin's friend and playmate. They live with Calvin's long-suffering parents, who have to cope with his turbulent behaviour. The charm of the strip is multi-faceted. On the one hand, Calvin is a typical six-year-old with a vivid imagination: one minute he is fearless intergalactic traveller Spaceman Spiff, crash-landing on a hostile planet, the next he is a fearsome T-Rex stalking his victim through the Jurassic jungle. He is in thrall to consumerism, hates school, loves making gruesome snowmen, and plays Calvinball, an anarchic game of ever-changing rules. Yet he is also given to philosophising about the big issues of life, ably supported or gently undermined by Hobbes's quietly caustic asides . Here is an outlet for Watterson's deeply-held views about the craziness of the modern world; indeed, the artist himself has always shunned publicity. The strip is also enhanced by its strong cast of supporting characters. Mrs Wormwood the teacher looms over Calvin when he not paying attention; the school bully is always on hand to 'pound' him; Susie, the little girl from down the road, often gets her own back on her snowball-throwing nemesis. Calvin's dad is a particularly funny creation: long-suffering, anti-media, and a proponent of fresh air, he also manages to get his revenge on his manic son by tying him up in mental knots with spurious bits of information . All these ingredients would, in the right hands, combine to make a perfectly good comic strip, but what always put Calvin and Hobbes ahead of the competition was the sheer artistry of Watterson's illustrations. In this regard, the chronological arrangement of the strips usefully shows Watterson's increasingly sophisticated technique, from his drawings of desert canyons and hideous inhabitants of alien planets, to the facial expressions of all his characters. It is hard to deny that Watterson owes a debt to Charles Schulz, whose Peanuts strip also offered a sophisticated yet deceptively simple evocation of the inner lives of children. For Calvin and Hobbes, however, Watterson combined uncanny ability, more than a touch of surrealism and a huge dose of humour to distil the essence of late-twentieth-century childhood, thereby elevating his strip into a league of its own.

On the eve of battle, Sir Thomas Lemuel Hawke of Cornwall writes a letter to his children. It is a guide on how to live well, like a knight: staying wise, humble, courageous, loving and kind.

This extraordinary graphic novel is so obviously a labour of love that the reader can only marvel at the energy that has been expended in its creation. Although the two plots that make up the book are essentially simple, the care with which Ware has executed them gives them an almost mythic quality. Jimmy Corrigan is a lonely, single, thirty-something with a boring job in an office cubicle, and a domineering mother who, in spite of living in a nursing home, is never far from the telephone or Jimmy. His crippling shyness renders him incapable of even saying hello to Peggy, the woman who works at an adjacent desk. When the father he has never known sends him an invitation and a plane ticket, Jimmy feels compelled to fly out to meet him. Jimmy's trip is mirrored by the boyhood tale of his grandfather, James, whose relationship with his father is tainted by unhappiness. Young James's mother has died, leaving his father with the unwanted job of bringing up the little boy alone, while at the same time maintaining his job as a glazier at the 1892 Chicago World's Fair. James is a frightened little boy, cowed by his father and bullied at school; he has a vagueness and fragility common to young, lonely and fearful children, qualities that are inherited generations later by his grandson. Chris Ware's illustrations are simply awe-inspiring in the true sense of the word. It is hard to believe that someone could put so much detail into each of the 380 pages that make up this incredible book, but there is a clue to his devotion in the afterword. After spending most of his life avoiding his own father, speaking only rarely on the phone, Ware finally met up with him: 'Gradually, the sublime outrageousness of our evening eroded into two people simply running out of things to say to each other. We weren't father and son anymore, just a pair of regretful men.'

But nothing is straightforward, and when Luna turns 13, everything will change. Kelly Barnhill won the Newbery Medal in the US for this thoughtful and magical book about belonging, fear and family, and itâs easy to see why.

Jennifer Niven's deeply compelling and highly successful first teen novel All The Bright Places was very much for an older audience with its themes of depression and suicide. Her new book Holding Up the Universe is suitable for younger teens as well - and just as powerfully written. The book is narrated in turns by Libby, famous for once being 'America's Fattest Teen' and starting high school after years of being home schooled, and Jack, who seems to be one of the popular kids but secretly suffers from Prospagnosia - the inability to recognise the faces of familiar people even those in this own family which is often called 'face blindness'. Their worlds collide in a horribly cruel high school game and an unlikely friendship is formed that leads to something even deeper. Jennifer Niven is a gorgeous writer. Her characters Libby and Jack feel so real that it's almost impossible to believe they don't live and breathe. The author herself struggled with weight issues and anxiety over the years, particularly as a teenager, so this writing comes from the heart. The spotlight on prosopagnosia sheds an interesting light on a little known but not so uncommon condition. The ultimate message is uplifting and positive and one that teenagers everywhere need to hear: be yourself and you deserve to be wanted and loved for who you are.Â

The comic-strip adventures of Calvin, a naughty boy with a philosophical bent, and his soft toy tiger companion Hobbes, delighted readers from 1985 to 1995. The huge achievement of the comic's creator Bill Watterson is celebrated here in this wonderful cloth-bound three-volume box set, which contains in chronological order every Calvin and Hobbes strip. For those who have never experienced the sheer delight of Watterson's creation, here is a brief summary: Calvin is an active and imaginative little boy; his friend Hobbes appears as a stuffed tiger when other people are around, but when the two of them are alone he comes to life and is Calvin's friend and playmate. They live with Calvin's long-suffering parents, who have to cope with his turbulent behaviour. The charm of the strip is multi-faceted. On the one hand, Calvin is a typical six-year-old with a vivid imagination: one minute he is fearless intergalactic traveller Spaceman Spiff, crash-landing on a hostile planet, the next he is a fearsome T-Rex stalking his victim through the Jurassic jungle. He is in thrall to consumerism, hates school, loves making gruesome snowmen, and plays Calvinball, an anarchic game of ever-changing rules. Yet he is also given to philosophising about the big issues of life, ably supported or gently undermined by Hobbes's quietly caustic asides . Here is an outlet for Watterson's deeply-held views about the craziness of the modern world; indeed, the artist himself has always shunned publicity. The strip is also enhanced by its strong cast of supporting characters. Mrs Wormwood the teacher looms over Calvin when he not paying attention; the school bully is always on hand to 'pound' him; Susie, the little girl from down the road, often gets her own back on her snowball-throwing nemesis. Calvin's dad is a particularly funny creation: long-suffering, anti-media, and a proponent of fresh air, he also manages to get his revenge on his manic son by tying him up in mental knots with spurious bits of information . All these ingredients would, in the right hands, combine to make a perfectly good comic strip, but what always put Calvin and Hobbes ahead of the competition was the sheer artistry of Watterson's illustrations. In this regard, the chronological arrangement of the strips usefully shows Watterson's increasingly sophisticated technique, from his drawings of desert canyons and hideous inhabitants of alien planets, to the facial expressions of all his characters. It is hard to deny that Watterson owes a debt to Charles Schulz, whose Peanuts strip also offered a sophisticated yet deceptively simple evocation of the inner lives of children. For Calvin and Hobbes, however, Watterson combined uncanny ability, more than a touch of surrealism and a huge dose of humour to distil the essence of late-twentieth-century childhood, thereby elevating his strip into a league of its own.

This extraordinary graphic novel is so obviously a labour of love that the reader can only marvel at the energy that has been expended in its creation. Although the two plots that make up the book are essentially simple, the care with which Ware has executed them gives them an almost mythic quality. Jimmy Corrigan is a lonely, single, thirty-something with a boring job in an office cubicle, and a domineering mother who, in spite of living in a nursing home, is never far from the telephone or Jimmy. His crippling shyness renders him incapable of even saying hello to Peggy, the woman who works at an adjacent desk. When the father he has never known sends him an invitation and a plane ticket, Jimmy feels compelled to fly out to meet him. Jimmy's trip is mirrored by the boyhood tale of his grandfather, James, whose relationship with his father is tainted by unhappiness. Young James's mother has died, leaving his father with the unwanted job of bringing up the little boy alone, while at the same time maintaining his job as a glazier at the 1892 Chicago World's Fair. James is a frightened little boy, cowed by his father and bullied at school; he has a vagueness and fragility common to young, lonely and fearful children, qualities that are inherited generations later by his grandson. Chris Ware's illustrations are simply awe-inspiring in the true sense of the word. It is hard to believe that someone could put so much detail into each of the 380 pages that make up this incredible book, but there is a clue to his devotion in the afterword. After spending most of his life avoiding his own father, speaking only rarely on the phone, Ware finally met up with him: 'Gradually, the sublime outrageousness of our evening eroded into two people simply running out of things to say to each other. We weren't father and son anymore, just a pair of regretful men.'

Every year, the evil Protectorate offers a baby to the evil witch in the forest to ensure their villageâs safety. Yet, unknown to them, the witch is Xan, the plump and knowledgeable protector of the babies that she takes to the neighbouring village to be raised as special children, fed on starlight and destined to do wonderful things.

Xan is a delightfully pleasant and caring crone witch who dispels the traditional image of cackling evildoer, and replaces it with something far more loving and magical.

Readers are drawn into the tension between the emotional bond which Ben and his mother form with Zan, the demands of the research which dominate the attitude of Ben's more inhibited father, and the increasingly fraught relationship he has with his wife and son. Oppel also examines Benâs teenage angst over his own personal relationships, and the ethics of animal experimentation in this absorbing novel.

Jennifer Niven's deeply compelling and highly successful first teen novel All The Bright Places was very much for an older audience with its themes of depression and suicide. Her new book Holding Up the Universe is suitable for younger teens as well - and just as powerfully written. The book is narrated in turns by Libby, famous for once being 'America's Fattest Teen' and starting high school after years of being home schooled, and Jack, who seems to be one of the popular kids but secretly suffers from Prospagnosia - the inability to recognise the faces of familiar people even those in this own family which is often called 'face blindness'. Their worlds collide in a horribly cruel high school game and an unlikely friendship is formed that leads to something even deeper. Jennifer Niven is a gorgeous writer. Her characters Libby and Jack feel so real that it's almost impossible to believe they don't live and breathe. The author herself struggled with weight issues and anxiety over the years, particularly as a teenager, so this writing comes from the heart. The spotlight on prosopagnosia sheds an interesting light on a little known but not so uncommon condition. The ultimate message is uplifting and positive and one that teenagers everywhere need to hear: be yourself and you deserve to be wanted and loved for who you are.Â

The comic-strip adventures of Calvin, a naughty boy with a philosophical bent, and his soft toy tiger companion Hobbes, delighted readers from 1985 to 1995. The huge achievement of the comic's creator Bill Watterson is celebrated here in this wonderful cloth-bound three-volume box set, which contains in chronological order every Calvin and Hobbes strip. For those who have never experienced the sheer delight of Watterson's creation, here is a brief summary: Calvin is an active and imaginative little boy; his friend Hobbes appears as a stuffed tiger when other people are around, but when the two of them are alone he comes to life and is Calvin's friend and playmate. They live with Calvin's long-suffering parents, who have to cope with his turbulent behaviour. The charm of the strip is multi-faceted. On the one hand, Calvin is a typical six-year-old with a vivid imagination: one minute he is fearless intergalactic traveller Spaceman Spiff, crash-landing on a hostile planet, the next he is a fearsome T-Rex stalking his victim through the Jurassic jungle. He is in thrall to consumerism, hates school, loves making gruesome snowmen, and plays Calvinball, an anarchic game of ever-changing rules. Yet he is also given to philosophising about the big issues of life, ably supported or gently undermined by Hobbes's quietly caustic asides . Here is an outlet for Watterson's deeply-held views about the craziness of the modern world; indeed, the artist himself has always shunned publicity. The strip is also enhanced by its strong cast of supporting characters. Mrs Wormwood the teacher looms over Calvin when he not paying attention; the school bully is always on hand to 'pound' him; Susie, the little girl from down the road, often gets her own back on her snowball-throwing nemesis. Calvin's dad is a particularly funny creation: long-suffering, anti-media, and a proponent of fresh air, he also manages to get his revenge on his manic son by tying him up in mental knots with spurious bits of information . All these ingredients would, in the right hands, combine to make a perfectly good comic strip, but what always put Calvin and Hobbes ahead of the competition was the sheer artistry of Watterson's illustrations. In this regard, the chronological arrangement of the strips usefully shows Watterson's increasingly sophisticated technique, from his drawings of desert canyons and hideous inhabitants of alien planets, to the facial expressions of all his characters. It is hard to deny that Watterson owes a debt to Charles Schulz, whose Peanuts strip also offered a sophisticated yet deceptively simple evocation of the inner lives of children. For Calvin and Hobbes, however, Watterson combined uncanny ability, more than a touch of surrealism and a huge dose of humour to distil the essence of late-twentieth-century childhood, thereby elevating his strip into a league of its own.

On the eve of battle, Sir Thomas Lemuel Hawke of Cornwall writes a letter to his children. It is a guide on how to live well, like a knight: staying wise, humble, courageous, loving and kind.

This extraordinary graphic novel is so obviously a labour of love that the reader can only marvel at the energy that has been expended in its creation. Although the two plots that make up the book are essentially simple, the care with which Ware has executed them gives them an almost mythic quality. Jimmy Corrigan is a lonely, single, thirty-something with a boring job in an office cubicle, and a domineering mother who, in spite of living in a nursing home, is never far from the telephone or Jimmy. His crippling shyness renders him incapable of even saying hello to Peggy, the woman who works at an adjacent desk. When the father he has never known sends him an invitation and a plane ticket, Jimmy feels compelled to fly out to meet him. Jimmy's trip is mirrored by the boyhood tale of his grandfather, James, whose relationship with his father is tainted by unhappiness. Young James's mother has died, leaving his father with the unwanted job of bringing up the little boy alone, while at the same time maintaining his job as a glazier at the 1892 Chicago World's Fair. James is a frightened little boy, cowed by his father and bullied at school; he has a vagueness and fragility common to young, lonely and fearful children, qualities that are inherited generations later by his grandson. Chris Ware's illustrations are simply awe-inspiring in the true sense of the word. It is hard to believe that someone could put so much detail into each of the 380 pages that make up this incredible book, but there is a clue to his devotion in the afterword. After spending most of his life avoiding his own father, speaking only rarely on the phone, Ware finally met up with him: 'Gradually, the sublime outrageousness of our evening eroded into two people simply running out of things to say to each other. We weren't father and son anymore, just a pair of regretful men.'

Every year, the evil Protectorate offers a baby to the evil witch in the forest to ensure their villageâs safety. Yet, unknown to them, the witch is Xan, the plump and knowledgeable protector of the babies that she takes to the neighbouring village to be raised as special children, fed on starlight and destined to do wonderful things.

Xan is a delightfully pleasant and caring crone witch who dispels the traditional image of cackling evildoer, and replaces it with something far more loving and magical.

Oppel also examines Benâs teenage angst over his own personal relationships, and the ethics of animal experimentation in this absorbing novel.

Jennifer Niven's deeply compelling and highly successful first teen novel All The Bright Places was very much for an older audience with its themes of depression and suicide. Her new book Holding Up the Universe is suitable for younger teens as well - and just as powerfully written. The book is narrated in turns by Libby, famous for once being 'America's Fattest Teen' and starting high school after years of being home schooled, and Jack, who seems to be one of the popular kids but secretly suffers from Prospagnosia - the inability to recognise the faces of familiar people even those in this own family which is often called 'face blindness'. Their worlds collide in a horribly cruel high school game and an unlikely friendship is formed that leads to something even deeper. Jennifer Niven is a gorgeous writer. Her characters Libby and Jack feel so real that it's almost impossible to believe they don't live and breathe. The author herself struggled with weight issues and anxiety over the years, particularly as a teenager, so this writing comes from the heart. The spotlight on prosopagnosia sheds an interesting light on a little known but not so uncommon condition. The ultimate message is uplifting and positive and one that teenagers everywhere need to hear: be yourself and you deserve to be wanted and loved for who you are.Â

The comic-strip adventures of Calvin, a naughty boy with a philosophical bent, and his soft toy tiger companion Hobbes, delighted readers from 1985 to 1995. The huge achievement of the comic's creator Bill Watterson is celebrated here in this wonderful cloth-bound three-volume box set, which contains in chronological order every Calvin and Hobbes strip. For those who have never experienced the sheer delight of Watterson's creation, here is a brief summary: Calvin is an active and imaginative little boy; his friend Hobbes appears as a stuffed tiger when other people are around, but when the two of them are alone he comes to life and is Calvin's friend and playmate. They live with Calvin's long-suffering parents, who have to cope with his turbulent behaviour. The charm of the strip is multi-faceted. On the one hand, Calvin is a typical six-year-old with a vivid imagination: one minute he is fearless intergalactic traveller Spaceman Spiff, crash-landing on a hostile planet, the next he is a fearsome T-Rex stalking his victim through the Jurassic jungle. He is in thrall to consumerism, hates school, loves making gruesome snowmen, and plays Calvinball, an anarchic game of ever-changing rules. Yet he is also given to philosophising about the big issues of life, ably supported or gently undermined by Hobbes's quietly caustic asides . Here is an outlet for Watterson's deeply-held views about the craziness of the modern world; indeed, the artist himself has always shunned publicity. The strip is also enhanced by its strong cast of supporting characters. Mrs Wormwood the teacher looms over Calvin when he not paying attention; the school bully is always on hand to 'pound' him; Susie, the little girl from down the road, often gets her own back on her snowball-throwing nemesis. Calvin's dad is a particularly funny creation: long-suffering, anti-media, and a proponent of fresh air, he also manages to get his revenge on his manic son by tying him up in mental knots with spurious bits of information . All these ingredients would, in the right hands, combine to make a perfectly good comic strip, but what always put Calvin and Hobbes ahead of the competition was the sheer artistry of Watterson's illustrations. In this regard, the chronological arrangement of the strips usefully shows Watterson's increasingly sophisticated technique, from his drawings of desert canyons and hideous inhabitants of alien planets, to the facial expressions of all his characters. It is hard to deny that Watterson owes a debt to Charles Schulz, whose Peanuts strip also offered a sophisticated yet deceptively simple evocation of the inner lives of children. For Calvin and Hobbes, however, Watterson combined uncanny ability, more than a touch of surrealism and a huge dose of humour to distil the essence of late-twentieth-century childhood, thereby elevating his strip into a league of its own.

This extraordinary graphic novel is so obviously a labour of love that the reader can only marvel at the energy that has been expended in its creation. Although the two plots that make up the book are essentially simple, the care with which Ware has executed them gives them an almost mythic quality. Jimmy Corrigan is a lonely, single, thirty-something with a boring job in an office cubicle, and a domineering mother who, in spite of living in a nursing home, is never far from the telephone or Jimmy. His crippling shyness renders him incapable of even saying hello to Peggy, the woman who works at an adjacent desk. When the father he has never known sends him an invitation and a plane ticket, Jimmy feels compelled to fly out to meet him. Jimmy's trip is mirrored by the boyhood tale of his grandfather, James, whose relationship with his father is tainted by unhappiness. Young James's mother has died, leaving his father with the unwanted job of bringing up the little boy alone, while at the same time maintaining his job as a glazier at the 1892 Chicago World's Fair. James is a frightened little boy, cowed by his father and bullied at school; he has a vagueness and fragility common to young, lonely and fearful children, qualities that are inherited generations later by his grandson. Chris Ware's illustrations are simply awe-inspiring in the true sense of the word. It is hard to believe that someone could put so much detail into each of the 380 pages that make up this incredible book, but there is a clue to his devotion in the afterword. After spending most of his life avoiding his own father, speaking only rarely on the phone, Ware finally met up with him: 'Gradually, the sublime outrageousness of our evening eroded into two people simply running out of things to say to each other. We weren't father and son anymore, just a pair of regretful men.'

Every year, the evil Protectorate offers a baby to the evil witch in the forest to ensure their villageâs safety. Yet, unknown to them, the witch is Xan, the plump and knowledgeable protector of the babies that she takes to the neighbouring village to be raised as special children, fed on starlight and destined to do wonderful things. Yet, one day, Xan feeds one baby the moon by mistake and fills her with a huge amount of magicÂ â a dangerous amount, as it turns outÂ â so Xan decides to raise Luna as her own. But nothing is straightforward, and when Luna turns 13, everything will change. Kelly Barnhill won the Newbery Medal in the US for this thoughtful and magical book about belonging, fear and family, and itâs easy to see why. The writing flows beautifully and Barnhillâs keen observation of human nature fits naturally into the story, which moves along at a satisfying pace. Xan is a delightfully pleasant and caring crone witch who dispels the traditional image of cackling evildoer, and replaces it with something far more loving and magical.

Oppel also examines Benâs teenage angst over his own personal relationships, and the ethics of animal experimentation in this absorbing novel.

Jennifer Niven's deeply compelling and highly successful first teen novel All The Bright Places was very much for an older audience with its themes of depression and suicide. Her new book Holding Up the Universe is suitable for younger teens as well - and just as powerfully written. The book is narrated in turns by Libby, famous for once being 'America's Fattest Teen' and starting high school after years of being home schooled, and Jack, who seems to be one of the popular kids but secretly suffers from Prospagnosia - the inability to recognise the faces of familiar people even those in this own family which is often called 'face blindness'. Their worlds collide in a horribly cruel high school game and an unlikely friendship is formed that leads to something even deeper. Jennifer Niven is a gorgeous writer. Her characters Libby and Jack feel so real that it's almost impossible to believe they don't live and breathe. The author herself struggled with weight issues and anxiety over the years, particularly as a teenager, so this writing comes from the heart. The spotlight on prosopagnosia sheds an interesting light on a little known but not so uncommon condition. The ultimate message is uplifting and positive and one that teenagers everywhere need to hear: be yourself and you deserve to be wanted and loved for who you are.Â

The comic-strip adventures of Calvin, a naughty boy with a philosophical bent, and his soft toy tiger companion Hobbes, delighted readers from 1985 to 1995. The huge achievement of the comic's creator Bill Watterson is celebrated here in this wonderful cloth-bound three-volume box set, which contains in chronological order every Calvin and Hobbes strip. For those who have never experienced the sheer delight of Watterson's creation, here is a brief summary: Calvin is an active and imaginative little boy; his friend Hobbes appears as a stuffed tiger when other people are around, but when the two of them are alone he comes to life and is Calvin's friend and playmate. They live with Calvin's long-suffering parents, who have to cope with his turbulent behaviour. The charm of the strip is multi-faceted. On the one hand, Calvin is a typical six-year-old with a vivid imagination: one minute he is fearless intergalactic traveller Spaceman Spiff, crash-landing on a hostile planet, the next he is a fearsome T-Rex stalking his victim through the Jurassic jungle. He is in thrall to consumerism, hates school, loves making gruesome snowmen, and plays Calvinball, an anarchic game of ever-changing rules. Yet he is also given to philosophising about the big issues of life, ably supported or gently undermined by Hobbes's quietly caustic asides . Here is an outlet for Watterson's deeply-held views about the craziness of the modern world; indeed, the artist himself has always shunned publicity. The strip is also enhanced by its strong cast of supporting characters. Mrs Wormwood the teacher looms over Calvin when he not paying attention; the school bully is always on hand to 'pound' him; Susie, the little girl from down the road, often gets her own back on her snowball-throwing nemesis. Calvin's dad is a particularly funny creation: long-suffering, anti-media, and a proponent of fresh air, he also manages to get his revenge on his manic son by tying him up in mental knots with spurious bits of information . All these ingredients would, in the right hands, combine to make a perfectly good comic strip, but what always put Calvin and Hobbes ahead of the competition was the sheer artistry of Watterson's illustrations. In this regard, the chronological arrangement of the strips usefully shows Watterson's increasingly sophisticated technique, from his drawings of desert canyons and hideous inhabitants of alien planets, to the facial expressions of all his characters. It is hard to deny that Watterson owes a debt to Charles Schulz, whose Peanuts strip also offered a sophisticated yet deceptively simple evocation of the inner lives of children. For Calvin and Hobbes, however, Watterson combined uncanny ability, more than a touch of surrealism and a huge dose of humour to distil the essence of late-twentieth-century childhood, thereby elevating his strip into a league of its own.

This extraordinary graphic novel is so obviously a labour of love that the reader can only marvel at the energy that has been expended in its creation. Although the two plots that make up the book are essentially simple, the care with which Ware has executed them gives them an almost mythic quality. Jimmy Corrigan is a lonely, single, thirty-something with a boring job in an office cubicle, and a domineering mother who, in spite of living in a nursing home, is never far from the telephone or Jimmy. His crippling shyness renders him incapable of even saying hello to Peggy, the woman who works at an adjacent desk. When the father he has never known sends him an invitation and a plane ticket, Jimmy feels compelled to fly out to meet him. Jimmy's trip is mirrored by the boyhood tale of his grandfather, James, whose relationship with his father is tainted by unhappiness. Young James's mother has died, leaving his father with the unwanted job of bringing up the little boy alone, while at the same time maintaining his job as a glazier at the 1892 Chicago World's Fair. James is a frightened little boy, cowed by his father and bullied at school; he has a vagueness and fragility common to young, lonely and fearful children, qualities that are inherited generations later by his grandson. Chris Ware's illustrations are simply awe-inspiring in the true sense of the word. It is hard to believe that someone could put so much detail into each of the 380 pages that make up this incredible book, but there is a clue to his devotion in the afterword. After spending most of his life avoiding his own father, speaking only rarely on the phone, Ware finally met up with him: 'Gradually, the sublime outrageousness of our evening eroded into two people simply running out of things to say to each other. We weren't father and son anymore, just a pair of regretful men.'

Yet, unknown to them, the witch is Xan, the plump and knowledgeable protector of the babies that she takes to the neighbouring village to be raised as special children, fed on starlight and destined to do wonderful things. Yet, one day, Xan feeds one baby the moon by mistake and fills her with a huge amount of magicÂ â a dangerous amount, as it turns outÂ â so Xan decides to raise Luna as her own. But nothing is straightforward, and when Luna turns 13, everything will change. Kelly Barnhill won the Newbery Medal in the US for this thoughtful and magical book about belonging, fear and family, and itâs easy to see why. The writing flows beautifully and Barnhillâs keen observation of human nature fits naturally into the story, which moves along at a satisfying pace. Xan is a delightfully pleasant and caring crone witch who dispels the traditional image of cackling evildoer, and replaces it with something far more loving and magical. Neil Gaiman, Ursula Le Guin and Diana Wynne Jones.

Oppel also examines Benâs teenage angst over his own personal relationships, and the ethics of animal experimentation in this absorbing novel.

Jennifer Niven's deeply compelling and highly successful first teen novel All The Bright Places was very much for an older audience with its themes of depression and suicide. Her new book Holding Up the Universe is suitable for younger teens as well - and just as powerfully written. The book is narrated in turns by Libby, famous for once being 'America's Fattest Teen' and starting high school after years of being home schooled, and Jack, who seems to be one of the popular kids but secretly suffers from Prospagnosia - the inability to recognise the faces of familiar people even those in this own family which is often called 'face blindness'. Their worlds collide in a horribly cruel high school game and an unlikely friendship is formed that leads to something even deeper. Jennifer Niven is a gorgeous writer. Her characters Libby and Jack feel so real that it's almost impossible to believe they don't live and breathe. The author herself struggled with weight issues and anxiety over the years, particularly as a teenager, so this writing comes from the heart. The spotlight on prosopagnosia sheds an interesting light on a little known but not so uncommon condition. The ultimate message is uplifting and positive and one that teenagers everywhere need to hear: be yourself and you deserve to be wanted and loved for who you are.Â

The comic-strip adventures of Calvin, a naughty boy with a philosophical bent, and his soft toy tiger companion Hobbes, delighted readers from 1985 to 1995. The huge achievement of the comic's creator Bill Watterson is celebrated here in this wonderful cloth-bound three-volume box set, which contains in chronological order every Calvin and Hobbes strip. For those who have never experienced the sheer delight of Watterson's creation, here is a brief summary: Calvin is an active and imaginative little boy; his friend Hobbes appears as a stuffed tiger when other people are around, but when the two of them are alone he comes to life and is Calvin's friend and playmate. They live with Calvin's long-suffering parents, who have to cope with his turbulent behaviour. The charm of the strip is multi-faceted. On the one hand, Calvin is a typical six-year-old with a vivid imagination: one minute he is fearless intergalactic traveller Spaceman Spiff, crash-landing on a hostile planet, the next he is a fearsome T-Rex stalking his victim through the Jurassic jungle. He is in thrall to consumerism, hates school, loves making gruesome snowmen, and plays Calvinball, an anarchic game of ever-changing rules. Yet he is also given to philosophising about the big issues of life, ably supported or gently undermined by Hobbes's quietly caustic asides . Here is an outlet for Watterson's deeply-held views about the craziness of the modern world; indeed, the artist himself has always shunned publicity. The strip is also enhanced by its strong cast of supporting characters. Mrs Wormwood the teacher looms over Calvin when he not paying attention; the school bully is always on hand to 'pound' him; Susie, the little girl from down the road, often gets her own back on her snowball-throwing nemesis. Calvin's dad is a particularly funny creation: long-suffering, anti-media, and a proponent of fresh air, he also manages to get his revenge on his manic son by tying him up in mental knots with spurious bits of information . All these ingredients would, in the right hands, combine to make a perfectly good comic strip, but what always put Calvin and Hobbes ahead of the competition was the sheer artistry of Watterson's illustrations. In this regard, the chronological arrangement of the strips usefully shows Watterson's increasingly sophisticated technique, from his drawings of desert canyons and hideous inhabitants of alien planets, to the facial expressions of all his characters. It is hard to deny that Watterson owes a debt to Charles Schulz, whose Peanuts strip also offered a sophisticated yet deceptively simple evocation of the inner lives of children. For Calvin and Hobbes, however, Watterson combined uncanny ability, more than a touch of surrealism and a huge dose of humour to distil the essence of late-twentieth-century childhood, thereby elevating his strip into a league of its own.

This extraordinary graphic novel is so obviously a labour of love that the reader can only marvel at the energy that has been expended in its creation. Although the two plots that make up the book are essentially simple, the care with which Ware has executed them gives them an almost mythic quality. Jimmy Corrigan is a lonely, single, thirty-something with a boring job in an office cubicle, and a domineering mother who, in spite of living in a nursing home, is never far from the telephone or Jimmy. His crippling shyness renders him incapable of even saying hello to Peggy, the woman who works at an adjacent desk. When the father he has never known sends him an invitation and a plane ticket, Jimmy feels compelled to fly out to meet him. Jimmy's trip is mirrored by the boyhood tale of his grandfather, James, whose relationship with his father is tainted by unhappiness. Young James's mother has died, leaving his father with the unwanted job of bringing up the little boy alone, while at the same time maintaining his job as a glazier at the 1892 Chicago World's Fair. James is a frightened little boy, cowed by his father and bullied at school; he has a vagueness and fragility common to young, lonely and fearful children, qualities that are inherited generations later by his grandson. Chris Ware's illustrations are simply awe-inspiring in the true sense of the word. It is hard to believe that someone could put so much detail into each of the 380 pages that make up this incredible book, but there is a clue to his devotion in the afterword. After spending most of his life avoiding his own father, speaking only rarely on the phone, Ware finally met up with him: 'Gradually, the sublime outrageousness of our evening eroded into two people simply running out of things to say to each other. We weren't father and son anymore, just a pair of regretful men.'

Oppel also examines Benâs teenage angst over his own personal relationships, and the ethics of animal experimentation in this absorbing novel.

Jennifer Niven's deeply compelling and highly successful first teen novel All The Bright Places was very much for an older audience with its themes of depression and suicide. Her new book Holding Up the Universe is suitable for younger teens as well - and just as powerfully written. The book is narrated in turns by Libby, famous for once being 'America's Fattest Teen' and starting high school after years of being home schooled, and Jack, who seems to be one of the popular kids but secretly suffers from Prospagnosia - the inability to recognise the faces of familiar people even those in this own family which is often called 'face blindness'. Their worlds collide in a horribly cruel high school game and an unlikely friendship is formed that leads to something even deeper. Jennifer Niven is a gorgeous writer. Her characters Libby and Jack feel so real that it's almost impossible to believe they don't live and breathe. The author herself struggled with weight issues and anxiety over the years, particularly as a teenager, so this writing comes from the heart. The spotlight on prosopagnosia sheds an interesting light on a little known but not so uncommon condition. The ultimate message is uplifting and positive and one that teenagers everywhere need to hear: be yourself and you deserve to be wanted and loved for who you are.Â

The comic-strip adventures of Calvin, a naughty boy with a philosophical bent, and his soft toy tiger companion Hobbes, delighted readers from 1985 to 1995. The huge achievement of the comic's creator Bill Watterson is celebrated here in this wonderful cloth-bound three-volume box set, which contains in chronological order every Calvin and Hobbes strip. For those who have never experienced the sheer delight of Watterson's creation, here is a brief summary: Calvin is an active and imaginative little boy; his friend Hobbes appears as a stuffed tiger when other people are around, but when the two of them are alone he comes to life and is Calvin's friend and playmate. They live with Calvin's long-suffering parents, who have to cope with his turbulent behaviour. The charm of the strip is multi-faceted. On the one hand, Calvin is a typical six-year-old with a vivid imagination: one minute he is fearless intergalactic traveller Spaceman Spiff, crash-landing on a hostile planet, the next he is a fearsome T-Rex stalking his victim through the Jurassic jungle. He is in thrall to consumerism, hates school, loves making gruesome snowmen, and plays Calvinball, an anarchic game of ever-changing rules. Yet he is also given to philosophising about the big issues of life, ably supported or gently undermined by Hobbes's quietly caustic asides . Here is an outlet for Watterson's deeply-held views about the craziness of the modern world; indeed, the artist himself has always shunned publicity. The strip is also enhanced by its strong cast of supporting characters. Mrs Wormwood the teacher looms over Calvin when he not paying attention; the school bully is always on hand to 'pound' him; Susie, the little girl from down the road, often gets her own back on her snowball-throwing nemesis. Calvin's dad is a particularly funny creation: long-suffering, anti-media, and a proponent of fresh air, he also manages to get his revenge on his manic son by tying him up in mental knots with spurious bits of information . All these ingredients would, in the right hands, combine to make a perfectly good comic strip, but what always put Calvin and Hobbes ahead of the competition was the sheer artistry of Watterson's illustrations. In this regard, the chronological arrangement of the strips usefully shows Watterson's increasingly sophisticated technique, from his drawings of desert canyons and hideous inhabitants of alien planets, to the facial expressions of all his characters. It is hard to deny that Watterson owes a debt to Charles Schulz, whose Peanuts strip also offered a sophisticated yet deceptively simple evocation of the inner lives of children. For Calvin and Hobbes, however, Watterson combined uncanny ability, more than a touch of surrealism and a huge dose of humour to distil the essence of late-twentieth-century childhood, thereby elevating his strip into a league of its own.

This extraordinary graphic novel is so obviously a labour of love that the reader can only marvel at the energy that has been expended in its creation. Although the two plots that make up the book are essentially simple, the care with which Ware has executed them gives them an almost mythic quality. Jimmy Corrigan is a lonely, single, thirty-something with a boring job in an office cubicle, and a domineering mother who, in spite of living in a nursing home, is never far from the telephone or Jimmy. His crippling shyness renders him incapable of even saying hello to Peggy, the woman who works at an adjacent desk. When the father he has never known sends him an invitation and a plane ticket, Jimmy feels compelled to fly out to meet him. Jimmy's trip is mirrored by the boyhood tale of his grandfather, James, whose relationship with his father is tainted by unhappiness. Young James's mother has died, leaving his father with the unwanted job of bringing up the little boy alone, while at the same time maintaining his job as a glazier at the 1892 Chicago World's Fair. James is a frightened little boy, cowed by his father and bullied at school; he has a vagueness and fragility common to young, lonely and fearful children, qualities that are inherited generations later by his grandson. Chris Ware's illustrations are simply awe-inspiring in the true sense of the word. It is hard to believe that someone could put so much detail into each of the 380 pages that make up this incredible book, but there is a clue to his devotion in the afterword. After spending most of his life avoiding his own father, speaking only rarely on the phone, Ware finally met up with him: 'Gradually, the sublime outrageousness of our evening eroded into two people simply running out of things to say to each other. We weren't father and son anymore, just a pair of regretful men.'

Oppel also examines Benâs teenage angst over his own personal relationships, and the ethics of animal experimentation in this absorbing novel.

Jennifer Niven's deeply compelling and highly successful first teen novel All The Bright Places was very much for an older audience with its themes of depression and suicide. Her new book Holding Up the Universe is suitable for younger teens as well - and just as powerfully written. The book is narrated in turns by Libby, famous for once being 'America's Fattest Teen' and starting high school after years of being home schooled, and Jack, who seems to be one of the popular kids but secretly suffers from Prospagnosia - the inability to recognise the faces of familiar people even those in this own family which is often called 'face blindness'. Their worlds collide in a horribly cruel high school game and an unlikely friendship is formed that leads to something even deeper. Jennifer Niven is a gorgeous writer. Her characters Libby and Jack feel so real that it's almost impossible to believe they don't live and breathe. The author herself struggled with weight issues and anxiety over the years, particularly as a teenager, so this writing comes from the heart. The spotlight on prosopagnosia sheds an interesting light on a little known but not so uncommon condition. The ultimate message is uplifting and positive and one that teenagers everywhere need to hear: be yourself and you deserve to be wanted and loved for who you are.Â

The comic-strip adventures of Calvin, a naughty boy with a philosophical bent, and his soft toy tiger companion Hobbes, delighted readers from 1985 to 1995. The huge achievement of the comic's creator Bill Watterson is celebrated here in this wonderful cloth-bound three-volume box set, which contains in chronological order every Calvin and Hobbes strip. For those who have never experienced the sheer delight of Watterson's creation, here is a brief summary: Calvin is an active and imaginative little boy; his friend Hobbes appears as a stuffed tiger when other people are around, but when the two of them are alone he comes to life and is Calvin's friend and playmate. They live with Calvin's long-suffering parents, who have to cope with his turbulent behaviour. The charm of the strip is multi-faceted. On the one hand, Calvin is a typical six-year-old with a vivid imagination: one minute he is fearless intergalactic traveller Spaceman Spiff, crash-landing on a hostile planet, the next he is a fearsome T-Rex stalking his victim through the Jurassic jungle. He is in thrall to consumerism, hates school, loves making gruesome snowmen, and plays Calvinball, an anarchic game of ever-changing rules. Yet he is also given to philosophising about the big issues of life, ably supported or gently undermined by Hobbes's quietly caustic asides . Here is an outlet for Watterson's deeply-held views about the craziness of the modern world; indeed, the artist himself has always shunned publicity. The strip is also enhanced by its strong cast of supporting characters. Mrs Wormwood the teacher looms over Calvin when he not paying attention; the school bully is always on hand to 'pound' him; Susie, the little girl from down the road, often gets her own back on her snowball-throwing nemesis. Calvin's dad is a particularly funny creation: long-suffering, anti-media, and a proponent of fresh air, he also manages to get his revenge on his manic son by tying him up in mental knots with spurious bits of information . All these ingredients would, in the right hands, combine to make a perfectly good comic strip, but what always put Calvin and Hobbes ahead of the competition was the sheer artistry of Watterson's illustrations. In this regard, the chronological arrangement of the strips usefully shows Watterson's increasingly sophisticated technique, from his drawings of desert canyons and hideous inhabitants of alien planets, to the facial expressions of all his characters. It is hard to deny that Watterson owes a debt to Charles Schulz, whose Peanuts strip also offered a sophisticated yet deceptively simple evocation of the inner lives of children. For Calvin and Hobbes, however, Watterson combined uncanny ability, more than a touch of surrealism and a huge dose of humour to distil the essence of late-twentieth-century childhood, thereby elevating his strip into a league of its own.

This extraordinary graphic novel is so obviously a labour of love that the reader can only marvel at the energy that has been expended in its creation. Although the two plots that make up the book are essentially simple, the care with which Ware has executed them gives them an almost mythic quality. Jimmy Corrigan is a lonely, single, thirty-something with a boring job in an office cubicle, and a domineering mother who, in spite of living in a nursing home, is never far from the telephone or Jimmy. His crippling shyness renders him incapable of even saying hello to Peggy, the woman who works at an adjacent desk. When the father he has never known sends him an invitation and a plane ticket, Jimmy feels compelled to fly out to meet him. Jimmy's trip is mirrored by the boyhood tale of his grandfather, James, whose relationship with his father is tainted by unhappiness. Young James's mother has died, leaving his father with the unwanted job of bringing up the little boy alone, while at the same time maintaining his job as a glazier at the 1892 Chicago World's Fair. James is a frightened little boy, cowed by his father and bullied at school; he has a vagueness and fragility common to young, lonely and fearful children, qualities that are inherited generations later by his grandson. Chris Ware's illustrations are simply awe-inspiring in the true sense of the word. It is hard to believe that someone could put so much detail into each of the 380 pages that make up this incredible book, but there is a clue to his devotion in the afterword. After spending most of his life avoiding his own father, speaking only rarely on the phone, Ware finally met up with him: 'Gradually, the sublime outrageousness of our evening eroded into two people simply running out of things to say to each other. We weren't father and son anymore, just a pair of regretful men.'

Oppel also examines Benâs teenage angst over his own personal relationships, and the ethics of animal experimentation in this absorbing novel.

Jennifer Niven's deeply compelling and highly successful first teen novel All The Bright Places was very much for an older audience with its themes of depression and suicide. Her new book Holding Up the Universe is suitable for younger teens as well - and just as powerfully written. The book is narrated in turns by Libby, famous for once being 'America's Fattest Teen' and starting high school after years of being home schooled, and Jack, who seems to be one of the popular kids but secretly suffers from Prospagnosia - the inability to recognise the faces of familiar people even those in this own family which is often called 'face blindness'. Their worlds collide in a horribly cruel high school game and an unlikely friendship is formed that leads to something even deeper. Jennifer Niven is a gorgeous writer. Her characters Libby and Jack feel so real that it's almost impossible to believe they don't live and breathe. The author herself struggled with weight issues and anxiety over the years, particularly as a teenager, so this writing comes from the heart. The spotlight on prosopagnosia sheds an interesting light on a little known but not so uncommon condition. The ultimate message is uplifting and positive and one that teenagers everywhere need to hear: be yourself and you deserve to be wanted and loved for who you are.Â

The comic-strip adventures of Calvin, a naughty boy with a philosophical bent, and his soft toy tiger companion Hobbes, delighted readers from 1985 to 1995. The huge achievement of the comic's creator Bill Watterson is celebrated here in this wonderful cloth-bound three-volume box set, which contains in chronological order every Calvin and Hobbes strip. For those who have never experienced the sheer delight of Watterson's creation, here is a brief summary: Calvin is an active and imaginative little boy; his friend Hobbes appears as a stuffed tiger when other people are around, but when the two of them are alone he comes to life and is Calvin's friend and playmate. They live with Calvin's long-suffering parents, who have to cope with his turbulent behaviour. The charm of the strip is multi-faceted. On the one hand, Calvin is a typical six-year-old with a vivid imagination: one minute he is fearless intergalactic traveller Spaceman Spiff, crash-landing on a hostile planet, the next he is a fearsome T-Rex stalking his victim through the Jurassic jungle. He is in thrall to consumerism, hates school, loves making gruesome snowmen, and plays Calvinball, an anarchic game of ever-changing rules. Yet he is also given to philosophising about the big issues of life, ably supported or gently undermined by Hobbes's quietly caustic asides . Here is an outlet for Watterson's deeply-held views about the craziness of the modern world; indeed, the artist himself has always shunned publicity. The strip is also enhanced by its strong cast of supporting characters. Mrs Wormwood the teacher looms over Calvin when he not paying attention; the school bully is always on hand to 'pound' him; Susie, the little girl from down the road, often gets her own back on her snowball-throwing nemesis. Calvin's dad is a particularly funny creation: long-suffering, anti-media, and a proponent of fresh air, he also manages to get his revenge on his manic son by tying him up in mental knots with spurious bits of information . All these ingredients would, in the right hands, combine to make a perfectly good comic strip, but what always put Calvin and Hobbes ahead of the competition was the sheer artistry of Watterson's illustrations. In this regard, the chronological arrangement of the strips usefully shows Watterson's increasingly sophisticated technique, from his drawings of desert canyons and hideous inhabitants of alien planets, to the facial expressions of all his characters. It is hard to deny that Watterson owes a debt to Charles Schulz, whose Peanuts strip also offered a sophisticated yet deceptively simple evocation of the inner lives of children. For Calvin and Hobbes, however, Watterson combined uncanny ability, more than a touch of surrealism and a huge dose of humour to distil the essence of late-twentieth-century childhood, thereby elevating his strip into a league of its own.

This extraordinary graphic novel is so obviously a labour of love that the reader can only marvel at the energy that has been expended in its creation. Although the two plots that make up the book are essentially simple, the care with which Ware has executed them gives them an almost mythic quality. Jimmy Corrigan is a lonely, single, thirty-something with a boring job in an office cubicle, and a domineering mother who, in spite of living in a nursing home, is never far from the telephone or Jimmy. His crippling shyness renders him incapable of even saying hello to Peggy, the woman who works at an adjacent desk. When the father he has never known sends him an invitation and a plane ticket, Jimmy feels compelled to fly out to meet him. Jimmy's trip is mirrored by the boyhood tale of his grandfather, James, whose relationship with his father is tainted by unhappiness. Young James's mother has died, leaving his father with the unwanted job of bringing up the little boy alone, while at the same time maintaining his job as a glazier at the 1892 Chicago World's Fair. James is a frightened little boy, cowed by his father and bullied at school; he has a vagueness and fragility common to young, lonely and fearful children, qualities that are inherited generations later by his grandson. Chris Ware's illustrations are simply awe-inspiring in the true sense of the word. It is hard to believe that someone could put so much detail into each of the 380 pages that make up this incredible book, but there is a clue to his devotion in the afterword. After spending most of his life avoiding his own father, speaking only rarely on the phone, Ware finally met up with him: 'Gradually, the sublime outrageousness of our evening eroded into two people simply running out of things to say to each other. We weren't father and son anymore, just a pair of regretful men.'

Oppel bases his first YA novel on projects in the 1970s which tested the capability of chimpanzees to acquire sign language. His setting, facts, and outcomes closely mirror events then, and we meet thirteen-year old Ben, an only child whose researcher parents adopt a neonate chimp, Zan, and rear him as part of the family. Readers are drawn into the tension between the emotional bond which Ben and his mother form with Zan, the demands of the research which dominate the attitude of Ben's more inhibited father, and the increasingly fraught relationship he has with his wife and son. Oppel also examines Benâs teenage angst over his own personal relationships, and the ethics of animal experimentation in this absorbing novel.

Jennifer Niven's deeply compelling and highly successful first teen novel All The Bright Places was very much for an older audience with its themes of depression and suicide. Her new book Holding Up the Universe is suitable for younger teens as well - and just as powerfully written. The book is narrated in turns by Libby, famous for once being 'America's Fattest Teen' and starting high school after years of being home schooled, and Jack, who seems to be one of the popular kids but secretly suffers from Prospagnosia - the inability to recognise the faces of familiar people even those in this own family which is often called 'face blindness'. Their worlds collide in a horribly cruel high school game and an unlikely friendship is formed that leads to something even deeper. Jennifer Niven is a gorgeous writer. Her characters Libby and Jack feel so real that it's almost impossible to believe they don't live and breathe. The author herself struggled with weight issues and anxiety over the years, particularly as a teenager, so this writing comes from the heart. The spotlight on prosopagnosia sheds an interesting light on a little known but not so uncommon condition. The ultimate message is uplifting and positive and one that teenagers everywhere need to hear: be yourself and you deserve to be wanted and loved for who you are.Â

The comic-strip adventures of Calvin, a naughty boy with a philosophical bent, and his soft toy tiger companion Hobbes, delighted readers from 1985 to 1995. The huge achievement of the comic's creator Bill Watterson is celebrated here in this wonderful cloth-bound three-volume box set, which contains in chronological order every Calvin and Hobbes strip. For those who have never experienced the sheer delight of Watterson's creation, here is a brief summary: Calvin is an active and imaginative little boy; his friend Hobbes appears as a stuffed tiger when other people are around, but when the two of them are alone he comes to life and is Calvin's friend and playmate. They live with Calvin's long-suffering parents, who have to cope with his turbulent behaviour. The charm of the strip is multi-faceted. On the one hand, Calvin is a typical six-year-old with a vivid imagination: one minute he is fearless intergalactic traveller Spaceman Spiff, crash-landing on a hostile planet, the next he is a fearsome T-Rex stalking his victim through the Jurassic jungle. He is in thrall to consumerism, hates school, loves making gruesome snowmen, and plays Calvinball, an anarchic game of ever-changing rules. Yet he is also given to philosophising about the big issues of life, ably supported or gently undermined by Hobbes's quietly caustic asides . Here is an outlet for Watterson's deeply-held views about the craziness of the modern world; indeed, the artist himself has always shunned publicity. The strip is also enhanced by its strong cast of supporting characters. Mrs Wormwood the teacher looms over Calvin when he not paying attention; the school bully is always on hand to 'pound' him; Susie, the little girl from down the road, often gets her own back on her snowball-throwing nemesis. Calvin's dad is a particularly funny creation: long-suffering, anti-media, and a proponent of fresh air, he also manages to get his revenge on his manic son by tying him up in mental knots with spurious bits of information . All these ingredients would, in the right hands, combine to make a perfectly good comic strip, but what always put Calvin and Hobbes ahead of the competition was the sheer artistry of Watterson's illustrations. In this regard, the chronological arrangement of the strips usefully shows Watterson's increasingly sophisticated technique, from his drawings of desert canyons and hideous inhabitants of alien planets, to the facial expressions of all his characters. It is hard to deny that Watterson owes a debt to Charles Schulz, whose Peanuts strip also offered a sophisticated yet deceptively simple evocation of the inner lives of children. For Calvin and Hobbes, however, Watterson combined uncanny ability, more than a touch of surrealism and a huge dose of humour to distil the essence of late-twentieth-century childhood, thereby elevating his strip into a league of its own.

On the eve of battle, Sir Thomas Lemuel Hawke of Cornwall writes a letter to his children. It is a guide on how to live well, like a knight: staying wise, humble, courageous, loving and kind. Hawke has tried to make this book look as authentic as possible. The cover stands out with a gold-embossed leaf. Inside, an editorâs note talks about the discovery of the âhistoricalâ letter, confirming Sir Thomas's death at the Battle of Slaughter Bridge in 1483.It all gives the book an important and timeless feel. Hawke has a way with a sentence, and many of the sections read like note-perfect proverbs. There are also some lovely, tender scenes with the grandfather.

This extraordinary graphic novel is so obviously a labour of love that the reader can only marvel at the energy that has been expended in its creation. Although the two plots that make up the book are essentially simple, the care with which Ware has executed them gives them an almost mythic quality. Jimmy Corrigan is a lonely, single, thirty-something with a boring job in an office cubicle, and a domineering mother who, in spite of living in a nursing home, is never far from the telephone or Jimmy. His crippling shyness renders him incapable of even saying hello to Peggy, the woman who works at an adjacent desk. When the father he has never known sends him an invitation and a plane ticket, Jimmy feels compelled to fly out to meet him. Jimmy's trip is mirrored by the boyhood tale of his grandfather, James, whose relationship with his father is tainted by unhappiness. Young James's mother has died, leaving his father with the unwanted job of bringing up the little boy alone, while at the same time maintaining his job as a glazier at the 1892 Chicago World's Fair. James is a frightened little boy, cowed by his father and bullied at school; he has a vagueness and fragility common to young, lonely and fearful children, qualities that are inherited generations later by his grandson. Chris Ware's illustrations are simply awe-inspiring in the true sense of the word. It is hard to believe that someone could put so much detail into each of the 380 pages that make up this incredible book, but there is a clue to his devotion in the afterword. After spending most of his life avoiding his own father, speaking only rarely on the phone, Ware finally met up with him: 'Gradually, the sublime outrageousness of our evening eroded into two people simply running out of things to say to each other. We weren't father and son anymore, just a pair of regretful men.'

But nothing is straightforward, and when Luna turns 13, everything will change. Kelly Barnhill won the Newbery Medal in the US for this thoughtful and magical book about belonging, fear and family, and itâs easy to see why. The writing flows beautifully and Barnhillâs keen observation of human nature fits naturally into the story, which moves along at a satisfying pace. Xan is a delightfully pleasant and caring crone witch who dispels the traditional image of cackling evildoer, and replaces it with something far more loving and magical.

Jennifer Niven's deeply compelling and highly successful first teen novel All The Bright Places was very much for an older audience with its themes of depression and suicide. Her new book Holding Up the Universe is suitable for younger teens as well - and just as powerfully written. The book is narrated in turns by Libby, famous for once being 'America's Fattest Teen' and starting high school after years of being home schooled, and Jack, who seems to be one of the popular kids but secretly suffers from Prospagnosia - the inability to recognise the faces of familiar people even those in this own family which is often called 'face blindness'. Their worlds collide in a horribly cruel high school game and an unlikely friendship is formed that leads to something even deeper. Jennifer Niven is a gorgeous writer. Her characters Libby and Jack feel so real that it's almost impossible to believe they don't live and breathe. The author herself struggled with weight issues and anxiety over the years, particularly as a teenager, so this writing comes from the heart. The spotlight on prosopagnosia sheds an interesting light on a little known but not so uncommon condition. The ultimate message is uplifting and positive and one that teenagers everywhere need to hear: be yourself and you deserve to be wanted and loved for who you are.Â

The comic-strip adventures of Calvin, a naughty boy with a philosophical bent, and his soft toy tiger companion Hobbes, delighted readers from 1985 to 1995. The huge achievement of the comic's creator Bill Watterson is celebrated here in this wonderful cloth-bound three-volume box set, which contains in chronological order every Calvin and Hobbes strip. For those who have never experienced the sheer delight of Watterson's creation, here is a brief summary: Calvin is an active and imaginative little boy; his friend Hobbes appears as a stuffed tiger when other people are around, but when the two of them are alone he comes to life and is Calvin's friend and playmate. They live with Calvin's long-suffering parents, who have to cope with his turbulent behaviour. The charm of the strip is multi-faceted. On the one hand, Calvin is a typical six-year-old with a vivid imagination: one minute he is fearless intergalactic traveller Spaceman Spiff, crash-landing on a hostile planet, the next he is a fearsome T-Rex stalking his victim through the Jurassic jungle. He is in thrall to consumerism, hates school, loves making gruesome snowmen, and plays Calvinball, an anarchic game of ever-changing rules. Yet he is also given to philosophising about the big issues of life, ably supported or gently undermined by Hobbes's quietly caustic asides . Here is an outlet for Watterson's deeply-held views about the craziness of the modern world; indeed, the artist himself has always shunned publicity. The strip is also enhanced by its strong cast of supporting characters. Mrs Wormwood the teacher looms over Calvin when he not paying attention; the school bully is always on hand to 'pound' him; Susie, the little girl from down the road, often gets her own back on her snowball-throwing nemesis. Calvin's dad is a particularly funny creation: long-suffering, anti-media, and a proponent of fresh air, he also manages to get his revenge on his manic son by tying him up in mental knots with spurious bits of information . All these ingredients would, in the right hands, combine to make a perfectly good comic strip, but what always put Calvin and Hobbes ahead of the competition was the sheer artistry of Watterson's illustrations. In this regard, the chronological arrangement of the strips usefully shows Watterson's increasingly sophisticated technique, from his drawings of desert canyons and hideous inhabitants of alien planets, to the facial expressions of all his characters. It is hard to deny that Watterson owes a debt to Charles Schulz, whose Peanuts strip also offered a sophisticated yet deceptively simple evocation of the inner lives of children. For Calvin and Hobbes, however, Watterson combined uncanny ability, more than a touch of surrealism and a huge dose of humour to distil the essence of late-twentieth-century childhood, thereby elevating his strip into a league of its own.

On the eve of battle, Sir Thomas Lemuel Hawke of Cornwall writes a letter to his children. It is a guide on how to live well, like a knight: staying wise, humble, courageous, loving and kind. Hawke has tried to make this book look as authentic as possible. The cover stands out with a gold-embossed leaf. Inside, an editorâs note talks about the discovery of the âhistoricalâ letter, confirming Sir Thomas's death at the Battle of Slaughter Bridge in 1483.It all gives the book an important and timeless feel. Hawke has a way with a sentence, and many of the sections read like note-perfect proverbs. There are also some lovely, tender scenes with the grandfather.

This extraordinary graphic novel is so obviously a labour of love that the reader can only marvel at the energy that has been expended in its creation. Although the two plots that make up the book are essentially simple, the care with which Ware has executed them gives them an almost mythic quality. Jimmy Corrigan is a lonely, single, thirty-something with a boring job in an office cubicle, and a domineering mother who, in spite of living in a nursing home, is never far from the telephone or Jimmy. His crippling shyness renders him incapable of even saying hello to Peggy, the woman who works at an adjacent desk. When the father he has never known sends him an invitation and a plane ticket, Jimmy feels compelled to fly out to meet him. Jimmy's trip is mirrored by the boyhood tale of his grandfather, James, whose relationship with his father is tainted by unhappiness. Young James's mother has died, leaving his father with the unwanted job of bringing up the little boy alone, while at the same time maintaining his job as a glazier at the 1892 Chicago World's Fair. James is a frightened little boy, cowed by his father and bullied at school; he has a vagueness and fragility common to young, lonely and fearful children, qualities that are inherited generations later by his grandson. Chris Ware's illustrations are simply awe-inspiring in the true sense of the word. It is hard to believe that someone could put so much detail into each of the 380 pages that make up this incredible book, but there is a clue to his devotion in the afterword. After spending most of his life avoiding his own father, speaking only rarely on the phone, Ware finally met up with him: 'Gradually, the sublime outrageousness of our evening eroded into two people simply running out of things to say to each other. We weren't father and son anymore, just a pair of regretful men.'

Oppel bases his first YA novel on projects in the 1970s which tested the capability of chimpanzees to acquire sign language.

Readers are drawn into the tension between the emotional bond which Ben and his mother form with Zan, the demands of the research which dominate the attitude of Ben's more inhibited father, and the increasingly fraught relationship he has with his wife and son. Oppel also examines Benâs teenage angst over his own personal relationships, and the ethics of animal experimentation in this absorbing novel.

Jennifer Niven's deeply compelling and highly successful first teen novel All The Bright Places was very much for an older audience with its themes of depression and suicide. Her new book Holding Up the Universe is suitable for younger teens as well - and just as powerfully written. The book is narrated in turns by Libby, famous for once being 'America's Fattest Teen' and starting high school after years of being home schooled, and Jack, who seems to be one of the popular kids but secretly suffers from Prospagnosia - the inability to recognise the faces of familiar people even those in this own family which is often called 'face blindness'. Their worlds collide in a horribly cruel high school game and an unlikely friendship is formed that leads to something even deeper. Jennifer Niven is a gorgeous writer. Her characters Libby and Jack feel so real that it's almost impossible to believe they don't live and breathe. The author herself struggled with weight issues and anxiety over the years, particularly as a teenager, so this writing comes from the heart. The spotlight on prosopagnosia sheds an interesting light on a little known but not so uncommon condition. The ultimate message is uplifting and positive and one that teenagers everywhere need to hear: be yourself and you deserve to be wanted and loved for who you are.Â

The comic-strip adventures of Calvin, a naughty boy with a philosophical bent, and his soft toy tiger companion Hobbes, delighted readers from 1985 to 1995. The huge achievement of the comic's creator Bill Watterson is celebrated here in this wonderful cloth-bound three-volume box set, which contains in chronological order every Calvin and Hobbes strip. For those who have never experienced the sheer delight of Watterson's creation, here is a brief summary: Calvin is an active and imaginative little boy; his friend Hobbes appears as a stuffed tiger when other people are around, but when the two of them are alone he comes to life and is Calvin's friend and playmate. They live with Calvin's long-suffering parents, who have to cope with his turbulent behaviour. The charm of the strip is multi-faceted. On the one hand, Calvin is a typical six-year-old with a vivid imagination: one minute he is fearless intergalactic traveller Spaceman Spiff, crash-landing on a hostile planet, the next he is a fearsome T-Rex stalking his victim through the Jurassic jungle. He is in thrall to consumerism, hates school, loves making gruesome snowmen, and plays Calvinball, an anarchic game of ever-changing rules. Yet he is also given to philosophising about the big issues of life, ably supported or gently undermined by Hobbes's quietly caustic asides . Here is an outlet for Watterson's deeply-held views about the craziness of the modern world; indeed, the artist himself has always shunned publicity. The strip is also enhanced by its strong cast of supporting characters. Mrs Wormwood the teacher looms over Calvin when he not paying attention; the school bully is always on hand to 'pound' him; Susie, the little girl from down the road, often gets her own back on her snowball-throwing nemesis. Calvin's dad is a particularly funny creation: long-suffering, anti-media, and a proponent of fresh air, he also manages to get his revenge on his manic son by tying him up in mental knots with spurious bits of information . All these ingredients would, in the right hands, combine to make a perfectly good comic strip, but what always put Calvin and Hobbes ahead of the competition was the sheer artistry of Watterson's illustrations. In this regard, the chronological arrangement of the strips usefully shows Watterson's increasingly sophisticated technique, from his drawings of desert canyons and hideous inhabitants of alien planets, to the facial expressions of all his characters. It is hard to deny that Watterson owes a debt to Charles Schulz, whose Peanuts strip also offered a sophisticated yet deceptively simple evocation of the inner lives of children. For Calvin and Hobbes, however, Watterson combined uncanny ability, more than a touch of surrealism and a huge dose of humour to distil the essence of late-twentieth-century childhood, thereby elevating his strip into a league of its own.

On the eve of battle, Sir Thomas Lemuel Hawke of Cornwall writes a letter to his children. It is a guide on how to live well, like a knight: staying wise, humble, courageous, loving and kind.

This extraordinary graphic novel is so obviously a labour of love that the reader can only marvel at the energy that has been expended in its creation. Although the two plots that make up the book are essentially simple, the care with which Ware has executed them gives them an almost mythic quality. Jimmy Corrigan is a lonely, single, thirty-something with a boring job in an office cubicle, and a domineering mother who, in spite of living in a nursing home, is never far from the telephone or Jimmy. His crippling shyness renders him incapable of even saying hello to Peggy, the woman who works at an adjacent desk. When the father he has never known sends him an invitation and a plane ticket, Jimmy feels compelled to fly out to meet him. Jimmy's trip is mirrored by the boyhood tale of his grandfather, James, whose relationship with his father is tainted by unhappiness. Young James's mother has died, leaving his father with the unwanted job of bringing up the little boy alone, while at the same time maintaining his job as a glazier at the 1892 Chicago World's Fair. James is a frightened little boy, cowed by his father and bullied at school; he has a vagueness and fragility common to young, lonely and fearful children, qualities that are inherited generations later by his grandson. Chris Ware's illustrations are simply awe-inspiring in the true sense of the word. It is hard to believe that someone could put so much detail into each of the 380 pages that make up this incredible book, but there is a clue to his devotion in the afterword. After spending most of his life avoiding his own father, speaking only rarely on the phone, Ware finally met up with him: 'Gradually, the sublime outrageousness of our evening eroded into two people simply running out of things to say to each other. We weren't father and son anymore, just a pair of regretful men.'

Oppel bases his first YA novel on projects in the 1970s which tested the capability of chimpanzees to acquire sign language. His setting, facts, and outcomes closely mirror events then, and we meet thirteen-year old Ben, an only child whose researcher parents adopt a neonate chimp, Zan, and rear him as part of the family. Readers are drawn into the tension between the emotional bond which Ben and his mother form with Zan, the demands of the research which dominate the attitude of Ben's more inhibited father, and the increasingly fraught relationship he has with his wife and son. Oppel also examines Benâs teenage angst over his own personal relationships, and the ethics of animal experimentation in this absorbing novel.

Jennifer Niven's deeply compelling and highly successful first teen novel All The Bright Places was very much for an older audience with its themes of depression and suicide. Her new book Holding Up the Universe is suitable for younger teens as well - and just as powerfully written. The book is narrated in turns by Libby, famous for once being 'America's Fattest Teen' and starting high school after years of being home schooled, and Jack, who seems to be one of the popular kids but secretly suffers from Prospagnosia - the inability to recognise the faces of familiar people even those in this own family which is often called 'face blindness'. Their worlds collide in a horribly cruel high school game and an unlikely friendship is formed that leads to something even deeper. Jennifer Niven is a gorgeous writer. Her characters Libby and Jack feel so real that it's almost impossible to believe they don't live and breathe. The author herself struggled with weight issues and anxiety over the years, particularly as a teenager, so this writing comes from the heart. The spotlight on prosopagnosia sheds an interesting light on a little known but not so uncommon condition. The ultimate message is uplifting and positive and one that teenagers everywhere need to hear: be yourself and you deserve to be wanted and loved for who you are.Â

The comic-strip adventures of Calvin, a naughty boy with a philosophical bent, and his soft toy tiger companion Hobbes, delighted readers from 1985 to 1995. The huge achievement of the comic's creator Bill Watterson is celebrated here in this wonderful cloth-bound three-volume box set, which contains in chronological order every Calvin and Hobbes strip. For those who have never experienced the sheer delight of Watterson's creation, here is a brief summary: Calvin is an active and imaginative little boy; his friend Hobbes appears as a stuffed tiger when other people are around, but when the two of them are alone he comes to life and is Calvin's friend and playmate. They live with Calvin's long-suffering parents, who have to cope with his turbulent behaviour. The charm of the strip is multi-faceted. On the one hand, Calvin is a typical six-year-old with a vivid imagination: one minute he is fearless intergalactic traveller Spaceman Spiff, crash-landing on a hostile planet, the next he is a fearsome T-Rex stalking his victim through the Jurassic jungle. He is in thrall to consumerism, hates school, loves making gruesome snowmen, and plays Calvinball, an anarchic game of ever-changing rules. Yet he is also given to philosophising about the big issues of life, ably supported or gently undermined by Hobbes's quietly caustic asides . Here is an outlet for Watterson's deeply-held views about the craziness of the modern world; indeed, the artist himself has always shunned publicity. The strip is also enhanced by its strong cast of supporting characters. Mrs Wormwood the teacher looms over Calvin when he not paying attention; the school bully is always on hand to 'pound' him; Susie, the little girl from down the road, often gets her own back on her snowball-throwing nemesis. Calvin's dad is a particularly funny creation: long-suffering, anti-media, and a proponent of fresh air, he also manages to get his revenge on his manic son by tying him up in mental knots with spurious bits of information . All these ingredients would, in the right hands, combine to make a perfectly good comic strip, but what always put Calvin and Hobbes ahead of the competition was the sheer artistry of Watterson's illustrations. In this regard, the chronological arrangement of the strips usefully shows Watterson's increasingly sophisticated technique, from his drawings of desert canyons and hideous inhabitants of alien planets, to the facial expressions of all his characters. It is hard to deny that Watterson owes a debt to Charles Schulz, whose Peanuts strip also offered a sophisticated yet deceptively simple evocation of the inner lives of children. For Calvin and Hobbes, however, Watterson combined uncanny ability, more than a touch of surrealism and a huge dose of humour to distil the essence of late-twentieth-century childhood, thereby elevating his strip into a league of its own.

On the eve of battle, Sir Thomas Lemuel Hawke of Cornwall writes a letter to his children. It is a guide on how to live well, like a knight: staying wise, humble, courageous, loving and kind.

Hawke has a way with a sentence, and many of the sections read like note-perfect proverbs. There are also some lovely, tender scenes with the grandfather.

This extraordinary graphic novel is so obviously a labour of love that the reader can only marvel at the energy that has been expended in its creation. Although the two plots that make up the book are essentially simple, the care with which Ware has executed them gives them an almost mythic quality. Jimmy Corrigan is a lonely, single, thirty-something with a boring job in an office cubicle, and a domineering mother who, in spite of living in a nursing home, is never far from the telephone or Jimmy. His crippling shyness renders him incapable of even saying hello to Peggy, the woman who works at an adjacent desk. When the father he has never known sends him an invitation and a plane ticket, Jimmy feels compelled to fly out to meet him. Jimmy's trip is mirrored by the boyhood tale of his grandfather, James, whose relationship with his father is tainted by unhappiness. Young James's mother has died, leaving his father with the unwanted job of bringing up the little boy alone, while at the same time maintaining his job as a glazier at the 1892 Chicago World's Fair. James is a frightened little boy, cowed by his father and bullied at school; he has a vagueness and fragility common to young, lonely and fearful children, qualities that are inherited generations later by his grandson. Chris Ware's illustrations are simply awe-inspiring in the true sense of the word. It is hard to believe that someone could put so much detail into each of the 380 pages that make up this incredible book, but there is a clue to his devotion in the afterword. After spending most of his life avoiding his own father, speaking only rarely on the phone, Ware finally met up with him: 'Gradually, the sublime outrageousness of our evening eroded into two people simply running out of things to say to each other. We weren't father and son anymore, just a pair of regretful men.'

Oppel bases his first YA novel on projects in the 1970s which tested the capability of chimpanzees to acquire sign language. His setting, facts, and outcomes closely mirror events then, and we meet thirteen-year old Ben, an only child whose researcher parents adopt a neonate chimp, Zan, and rear him as part of the family. Readers are drawn into the tension between the emotional bond which Ben and his mother form with Zan, the demands of the research which dominate the attitude of Ben's more inhibited father, and the increasingly fraught relationship he has with his wife and son. Oppel also examines Benâs teenage angst over his own personal relationships, and the ethics of animal experimentation in this absorbing novel.

Jennifer Niven's deeply compelling and highly successful first teen novel All The Bright Places was very much for an older audience with its themes of depression and suicide. Her new book Holding Up the Universe is suitable for younger teens as well - and just as powerfully written. The book is narrated in turns by Libby, famous for once being 'America's Fattest Teen' and starting high school after years of being home schooled, and Jack, who seems to be one of the popular kids but secretly suffers from Prospagnosia - the inability to recognise the faces of familiar people even those in this own family which is often called 'face blindness'. Their worlds collide in a horribly cruel high school game and an unlikely friendship is formed that leads to something even deeper. Jennifer Niven is a gorgeous writer. Her characters Libby and Jack feel so real that it's almost impossible to believe they don't live and breathe. The author herself struggled with weight issues and anxiety over the years, particularly as a teenager, so this writing comes from the heart. The spotlight on prosopagnosia sheds an interesting light on a little known but not so uncommon condition. The ultimate message is uplifting and positive and one that teenagers everywhere need to hear: be yourself and you deserve to be wanted and loved for who you are.Â

The comic-strip adventures of Calvin, a naughty boy with a philosophical bent, and his soft toy tiger companion Hobbes, delighted readers from 1985 to 1995. The huge achievement of the comic's creator Bill Watterson is celebrated here in this wonderful cloth-bound three-volume box set, which contains in chronological order every Calvin and Hobbes strip. For those who have never experienced the sheer delight of Watterson's creation, here is a brief summary: Calvin is an active and imaginative little boy; his friend Hobbes appears as a stuffed tiger when other people are around, but when the two of them are alone he comes to life and is Calvin's friend and playmate. They live with Calvin's long-suffering parents, who have to cope with his turbulent behaviour. The charm of the strip is multi-faceted. On the one hand, Calvin is a typical six-year-old with a vivid imagination: one minute he is fearless intergalactic traveller Spaceman Spiff, crash-landing on a hostile planet, the next he is a fearsome T-Rex stalking his victim through the Jurassic jungle. He is in thrall to consumerism, hates school, loves making gruesome snowmen, and plays Calvinball, an anarchic game of ever-changing rules. Yet he is also given to philosophising about the big issues of life, ably supported or gently undermined by Hobbes's quietly caustic asides . Here is an outlet for Watterson's deeply-held views about the craziness of the modern world; indeed, the artist himself has always shunned publicity. The strip is also enhanced by its strong cast of supporting characters. Mrs Wormwood the teacher looms over Calvin when he not paying attention; the school bully is always on hand to 'pound' him; Susie, the little girl from down the road, often gets her own back on her snowball-throwing nemesis. Calvin's dad is a particularly funny creation: long-suffering, anti-media, and a proponent of fresh air, he also manages to get his revenge on his manic son by tying him up in mental knots with spurious bits of information . All these ingredients would, in the right hands, combine to make a perfectly good comic strip, but what always put Calvin and Hobbes ahead of the competition was the sheer artistry of Watterson's illustrations. In this regard, the chronological arrangement of the strips usefully shows Watterson's increasingly sophisticated technique, from his drawings of desert canyons and hideous inhabitants of alien planets, to the facial expressions of all his characters. It is hard to deny that Watterson owes a debt to Charles Schulz, whose Peanuts strip also offered a sophisticated yet deceptively simple evocation of the inner lives of children. For Calvin and Hobbes, however, Watterson combined uncanny ability, more than a touch of surrealism and a huge dose of humour to distil the essence of late-twentieth-century childhood, thereby elevating his strip into a league of its own.

On the eve of battle, Sir Thomas Lemuel Hawke of Cornwall writes a letter to his children. It is a guide on how to live well, like a knight: staying wise, humble, courageous, loving and kind.

Hawke has a way with a sentence, and many of the sections read like note-perfect proverbs. There are also some lovely, tender scenes with the grandfather.

This extraordinary graphic novel is so obviously a labour of love that the reader can only marvel at the energy that has been expended in its creation. Although the two plots that make up the book are essentially simple, the care with which Ware has executed them gives them an almost mythic quality. Jimmy Corrigan is a lonely, single, thirty-something with a boring job in an office cubicle, and a domineering mother who, in spite of living in a nursing home, is never far from the telephone or Jimmy. His crippling shyness renders him incapable of even saying hello to Peggy, the woman who works at an adjacent desk. When the father he has never known sends him an invitation and a plane ticket, Jimmy feels compelled to fly out to meet him. Jimmy's trip is mirrored by the boyhood tale of his grandfather, James, whose relationship with his father is tainted by unhappiness. Young James's mother has died, leaving his father with the unwanted job of bringing up the little boy alone, while at the same time maintaining his job as a glazier at the 1892 Chicago World's Fair. James is a frightened little boy, cowed by his father and bullied at school; he has a vagueness and fragility common to young, lonely and fearful children, qualities that are inherited generations later by his grandson. Chris Ware's illustrations are simply awe-inspiring in the true sense of the word. It is hard to believe that someone could put so much detail into each of the 380 pages that make up this incredible book, but there is a clue to his devotion in the afterword. After spending most of his life avoiding his own father, speaking only rarely on the phone, Ware finally met up with him: 'Gradually, the sublime outrageousness of our evening eroded into two people simply running out of things to say to each other. We weren't father and son anymore, just a pair of regretful men.'

Then a new guard arrives, one with an easy smile that belies his deadly swordsmanship. He sees past the executioner robes to the girl beneath, and a friendship blossoms between him and Twylla, a friendship that could be more if Twylla wasn't promised to the prince. But her romantic problems are trivial when she discovers the mad plan that the power-hungry and vicious queen is plotting. As everything begins to spiral out of control, Twylla has to decide who she trusts, who she loves, and what she is willing to do for her kingdom. The Sin Eater's Daughter is a truly original fantasy set in a richly imagined world full of complex and complicated characters. The world is multi-layered and Salisbury deftly weaves in original legends, myths, and histories to bring the world to life. Against this backdrop, political schemes and wicked plots unfold, with Twylla caught in the middle of it all. The plot is as intricate as the world and full of unexpected twists, each one more shocking than the last. The Sin Eater's Daughter is a delicious read, and while the ending is satisfying, it will leave readers hungry for the next instalment in the series.

Oppel bases his first YA novel on projects in the 1970s which tested the capability of chimpanzees to acquire sign language. His setting, facts, and outcomes closely mirror events then, and we meet thirteen-year old Ben, an only child whose researcher parents adopt a neonate chimp, Zan, and rear him as part of the family. Readers are drawn into the tension between the emotional bond which Ben and his mother form with Zan, the demands of the research which dominate the attitude of Ben's more inhibited father, and the increasingly fraught relationship he has with his wife and son. Oppel also examines Benâs teenage angst over his own personal relationships, and the ethics of animal experimentation in this absorbing novel.

Jennifer Niven's deeply compelling and highly successful first teen novel All The Bright Places was very much for an older audience with its themes of depression and suicide. Her new book Holding Up the Universe is suitable for younger teens as well - and just as powerfully written. The book is narrated in turns by Libby, famous for once being 'America's Fattest Teen' and starting high school after years of being home schooled, and Jack, who seems to be one of the popular kids but secretly suffers from Prospagnosia - the inability to recognise the faces of familiar people even those in this own family which is often called 'face blindness'. Their worlds collide in a horribly cruel high school game and an unlikely friendship is formed that leads to something even deeper. Jennifer Niven is a gorgeous writer. Her characters Libby and Jack feel so real that it's almost impossible to believe they don't live and breathe. The author herself struggled with weight issues and anxiety over the years, particularly as a teenager, so this writing comes from the heart. The spotlight on prosopagnosia sheds an interesting light on a little known but not so uncommon condition. The ultimate message is uplifting and positive and one that teenagers everywhere need to hear: be yourself and you deserve to be wanted and loved for who you are.Â

The comic-strip adventures of Calvin, a naughty boy with a philosophical bent, and his soft toy tiger companion Hobbes, delighted readers from 1985 to 1995. The huge achievement of the comic's creator Bill Watterson is celebrated here in this wonderful cloth-bound three-volume box set, which contains in chronological order every Calvin and Hobbes strip. For those who have never experienced the sheer delight of Watterson's creation, here is a brief summary: Calvin is an active and imaginative little boy; his friend Hobbes appears as a stuffed tiger when other people are around, but when the two of them are alone he comes to life and is Calvin's friend and playmate. They live with Calvin's long-suffering parents, who have to cope with his turbulent behaviour. The charm of the strip is multi-faceted. On the one hand, Calvin is a typical six-year-old with a vivid imagination: one minute he is fearless intergalactic traveller Spaceman Spiff, crash-landing on a hostile planet, the next he is a fearsome T-Rex stalking his victim through the Jurassic jungle. He is in thrall to consumerism, hates school, loves making gruesome snowmen, and plays Calvinball, an anarchic game of ever-changing rules. Yet he is also given to philosophising about the big issues of life, ably supported or gently undermined by Hobbes's quietly caustic asides . Here is an outlet for Watterson's deeply-held views about the craziness of the modern world; indeed, the artist himself has always shunned publicity. The strip is also enhanced by its strong cast of supporting characters. Mrs Wormwood the teacher looms over Calvin when he not paying attention; the school bully is always on hand to 'pound' him; Susie, the little girl from down the road, often gets her own back on her snowball-throwing nemesis. Calvin's dad is a particularly funny creation: long-suffering, anti-media, and a proponent of fresh air, he also manages to get his revenge on his manic son by tying him up in mental knots with spurious bits of information . All these ingredients would, in the right hands, combine to make a perfectly good comic strip, but what always put Calvin and Hobbes ahead of the competition was the sheer artistry of Watterson's illustrations. In this regard, the chronological arrangement of the strips usefully shows Watterson's increasingly sophisticated technique, from his drawings of desert canyons and hideous inhabitants of alien planets, to the facial expressions of all his characters. It is hard to deny that Watterson owes a debt to Charles Schulz, whose Peanuts strip also offered a sophisticated yet deceptively simple evocation of the inner lives of children. For Calvin and Hobbes, however, Watterson combined uncanny ability, more than a touch of surrealism and a huge dose of humour to distil the essence of late-twentieth-century childhood, thereby elevating his strip into a league of its own.

On the eve of battle, Sir Thomas Lemuel Hawke of Cornwall writes a letter to his children. It is a guide on how to live well, like a knight: staying wise, humble, courageous, loving and kind.

Hawke has a way with a sentence, and many of the sections read like note-perfect proverbs. There are also some lovely, tender scenes with the grandfather.

This extraordinary graphic novel is so obviously a labour of love that the reader can only marvel at the energy that has been expended in its creation. Although the two plots that make up the book are essentially simple, the care with which Ware has executed them gives them an almost mythic quality. Jimmy Corrigan is a lonely, single, thirty-something with a boring job in an office cubicle, and a domineering mother who, in spite of living in a nursing home, is never far from the telephone or Jimmy. His crippling shyness renders him incapable of even saying hello to Peggy, the woman who works at an adjacent desk. When the father he has never known sends him an invitation and a plane ticket, Jimmy feels compelled to fly out to meet him. Jimmy's trip is mirrored by the boyhood tale of his grandfather, James, whose relationship with his father is tainted by unhappiness. Young James's mother has died, leaving his father with the unwanted job of bringing up the little boy alone, while at the same time maintaining his job as a glazier at the 1892 Chicago World's Fair. James is a frightened little boy, cowed by his father and bullied at school; he has a vagueness and fragility common to young, lonely and fearful children, qualities that are inherited generations later by his grandson. Chris Ware's illustrations are simply awe-inspiring in the true sense of the word. It is hard to believe that someone could put so much detail into each of the 380 pages that make up this incredible book, but there is a clue to his devotion in the afterword. After spending most of his life avoiding his own father, speaking only rarely on the phone, Ware finally met up with him: 'Gradually, the sublime outrageousness of our evening eroded into two people simply running out of things to say to each other. We weren't father and son anymore, just a pair of regretful men.'

Oppel bases his first YA novel on projects in the 1970s which tested the capability of chimpanzees to acquire sign language. His setting, facts, and outcomes closely mirror events then, and we meet thirteen-year old Ben, an only child whose researcher parents adopt a neonate chimp, Zan, and rear him as part of the family. Readers are drawn into the tension between the emotional bond which Ben and his mother form with Zan, the demands of the research which dominate the attitude of Ben's more inhibited father, and the increasingly fraught relationship he has with his wife and son. Oppel also examines Benâs teenage angst over his own personal relationships, and the ethics of animal experimentation in this absorbing novel.

Jennifer Niven's deeply compelling and highly successful first teen novel All The Bright Places was very much for an older audience with its themes of depression and suicide. Her new book Holding Up the Universe is suitable for younger teens as well - and just as powerfully written. The book is narrated in turns by Libby, famous for once being 'America's Fattest Teen' and starting high school after years of being home schooled, and Jack, who seems to be one of the popular kids but secretly suffers from Prospagnosia - the inability to recognise the faces of familiar people even those in this own family which is often called 'face blindness'. Their worlds collide in a horribly cruel high school game and an unlikely friendship is formed that leads to something even deeper. Jennifer Niven is a gorgeous writer. Her characters Libby and Jack feel so real that it's almost impossible to believe they don't live and breathe. The author herself struggled with weight issues and anxiety over the years, particularly as a teenager, so this writing comes from the heart. The spotlight on prosopagnosia sheds an interesting light on a little known but not so uncommon condition. The ultimate message is uplifting and positive and one that teenagers everywhere need to hear: be yourself and you deserve to be wanted and loved for who you are.Â

The comic-strip adventures of Calvin, a naughty boy with a philosophical bent, and his soft toy tiger companion Hobbes, delighted readers from 1985 to 1995. The huge achievement of the comic's creator Bill Watterson is celebrated here in this wonderful cloth-bound three-volume box set, which contains in chronological order every Calvin and Hobbes strip. For those who have never experienced the sheer delight of Watterson's creation, here is a brief summary: Calvin is an active and imaginative little boy; his friend Hobbes appears as a stuffed tiger when other people are around, but when the two of them are alone he comes to life and is Calvin's friend and playmate. They live with Calvin's long-suffering parents, who have to cope with his turbulent behaviour. The charm of the strip is multi-faceted. On the one hand, Calvin is a typical six-year-old with a vivid imagination: one minute he is fearless intergalactic traveller Spaceman Spiff, crash-landing on a hostile planet, the next he is a fearsome T-Rex stalking his victim through the Jurassic jungle. He is in thrall to consumerism, hates school, loves making gruesome snowmen, and plays Calvinball, an anarchic game of ever-changing rules. Yet he is also given to philosophising about the big issues of life, ably supported or gently undermined by Hobbes's quietly caustic asides . Here is an outlet for Watterson's deeply-held views about the craziness of the modern world; indeed, the artist himself has always shunned publicity. The strip is also enhanced by its strong cast of supporting characters. Mrs Wormwood the teacher looms over Calvin when he not paying attention; the school bully is always on hand to 'pound' him; Susie, the little girl from down the road, often gets her own back on her snowball-throwing nemesis. Calvin's dad is a particularly funny creation: long-suffering, anti-media, and a proponent of fresh air, he also manages to get his revenge on his manic son by tying him up in mental knots with spurious bits of information . All these ingredients would, in the right hands, combine to make a perfectly good comic strip, but what always put Calvin and Hobbes ahead of the competition was the sheer artistry of Watterson's illustrations. In this regard, the chronological arrangement of the strips usefully shows Watterson's increasingly sophisticated technique, from his drawings of desert canyons and hideous inhabitants of alien planets, to the facial expressions of all his characters. It is hard to deny that Watterson owes a debt to Charles Schulz, whose Peanuts strip also offered a sophisticated yet deceptively simple evocation of the inner lives of children. For Calvin and Hobbes, however, Watterson combined uncanny ability, more than a touch of surrealism and a huge dose of humour to distil the essence of late-twentieth-century childhood, thereby elevating his strip into a league of its own.

On the eve of battle, Sir Thomas Lemuel Hawke of Cornwall writes a letter to his children. It is a guide on how to live well, like a knight: staying wise, humble, courageous, loving and kind.

This extraordinary graphic novel is so obviously a labour of love that the reader can only marvel at the energy that has been expended in its creation. Although the two plots that make up the book are essentially simple, the care with which Ware has executed them gives them an almost mythic quality. Jimmy Corrigan is a lonely, single, thirty-something with a boring job in an office cubicle, and a domineering mother who, in spite of living in a nursing home, is never far from the telephone or Jimmy. His crippling shyness renders him incapable of even saying hello to Peggy, the woman who works at an adjacent desk. When the father he has never known sends him an invitation and a plane ticket, Jimmy feels compelled to fly out to meet him. Jimmy's trip is mirrored by the boyhood tale of his grandfather, James, whose relationship with his father is tainted by unhappiness. Young James's mother has died, leaving his father with the unwanted job of bringing up the little boy alone, while at the same time maintaining his job as a glazier at the 1892 Chicago World's Fair. James is a frightened little boy, cowed by his father and bullied at school; he has a vagueness and fragility common to young, lonely and fearful children, qualities that are inherited generations later by his grandson. Chris Ware's illustrations are simply awe-inspiring in the true sense of the word. It is hard to believe that someone could put so much detail into each of the 380 pages that make up this incredible book, but there is a clue to his devotion in the afterword. After spending most of his life avoiding his own father, speaking only rarely on the phone, Ware finally met up with him: 'Gradually, the sublime outrageousness of our evening eroded into two people simply running out of things to say to each other. We weren't father and son anymore, just a pair of regretful men.'

Xan is a delightfully pleasant and caring crone witch who dispels the traditional image of cackling evildoer, and replaces it with something far more loving and magical.

One day, after the bullies throw her bag in the middle of a huge patch of stinging nettles, Nick Underbridge comes to her aid - a strange boy that everyone makes fun of at school for his hugeness and odd, unidentifiable smell.Â As Frank and Nick become friends, Frank discovers something strange and wonderful in Nick's basement - and an explanation for what holds him apart from the others at school. A sometimes sad and sometimes wry tale of bullying and fitting in, The Song From Somewhere Else is also a magical tale about how - sometimes - people might feel alien to us, but that families are universal, whoever you are. Levi Pinfold's stunning, intricate and moody illustrations add an extra layer of atmosphere to this heartfelt and beautifully strange story. Winner of the Kate Greenaway Amnesty CLIP Honour in 2018.

Suzy Smith is very surprised when a huge magical train takes a shortcut through her downstairs hallway one evening. Staffed by trolls, the Impossible Postal Express delivers letters and parcels across a series of magical worlds connected to our own: the Union of Impossible Places. Her curiosity getting the better of her, Suzy hitches a ride and becomes the newest postie. But when her first delivery goes disastrously wrong, she's not only caught up in an amazing magical adventure, but the fate of the Union itself rests on her shoulders... Two towers locked in a power struggle, a cursed boy trapped in a snowglobe, warrior statues, wormholes and negotiable gravity are just a few things Suzy encounters on her incredible journey. Knowledge is power in the Impossible Places, but who is telling the whole truth? Suzy has a brilliant scientific mind, but isn't really one for thinking about consequences â she tends more towards jumping now and thinking later, though her heart is definitely in the right place.

Oppel bases his first YA novel on projects in the 1970s which tested the capability of chimpanzees to acquire sign language. His setting, facts, and outcomes closely mirror events then, and we meet thirteen-year old Ben, an only child whose researcher parents adopt a neonate chimp, Zan, and rear him as part of the family. Readers are drawn into the tension between the emotional bond which Ben and his mother form with Zan, the demands of the research which dominate the attitude of Ben's more inhibited father, and the increasingly fraught relationship he has with his wife and son. Oppel also examines Benâs teenage angst over his own personal relationships, and the ethics of animal experimentation in this absorbing novel.

Jennifer Niven's deeply compelling and highly successful first teen novel All The Bright Places was very much for an older audience with its themes of depression and suicide. Her new book Holding Up the Universe is suitable for younger teens as well - and just as powerfully written. The book is narrated in turns by Libby, famous for once being 'America's Fattest Teen' and starting high school after years of being home schooled, and Jack, who seems to be one of the popular kids but secretly suffers from Prospagnosia - the inability to recognise the faces of familiar people even those in this own family which is often called 'face blindness'. Their worlds collide in a horribly cruel high school game and an unlikely friendship is formed that leads to something even deeper. Jennifer Niven is a gorgeous writer. Her characters Libby and Jack feel so real that it's almost impossible to believe they don't live and breathe. The author herself struggled with weight issues and anxiety over the years, particularly as a teenager, so this writing comes from the heart. The spotlight on prosopagnosia sheds an interesting light on a little known but not so uncommon condition. The ultimate message is uplifting and positive and one that teenagers everywhere need to hear: be yourself and you deserve to be wanted and loved for who you are.Â

The comic-strip adventures of Calvin, a naughty boy with a philosophical bent, and his soft toy tiger companion Hobbes, delighted readers from 1985 to 1995. The huge achievement of the comic's creator Bill Watterson is celebrated here in this wonderful cloth-bound three-volume box set, which contains in chronological order every Calvin and Hobbes strip. For those who have never experienced the sheer delight of Watterson's creation, here is a brief summary: Calvin is an active and imaginative little boy; his friend Hobbes appears as a stuffed tiger when other people are around, but when the two of them are alone he comes to life and is Calvin's friend and playmate. They live with Calvin's long-suffering parents, who have to cope with his turbulent behaviour. The charm of the strip is multi-faceted. On the one hand, Calvin is a typical six-year-old with a vivid imagination: one minute he is fearless intergalactic traveller Spaceman Spiff, crash-landing on a hostile planet, the next he is a fearsome T-Rex stalking his victim through the Jurassic jungle. He is in thrall to consumerism, hates school, loves making gruesome snowmen, and plays Calvinball, an anarchic game of ever-changing rules. Yet he is also given to philosophising about the big issues of life, ably supported or gently undermined by Hobbes's quietly caustic asides . Here is an outlet for Watterson's deeply-held views about the craziness of the modern world; indeed, the artist himself has always shunned publicity. The strip is also enhanced by its strong cast of supporting characters. Mrs Wormwood the teacher looms over Calvin when he not paying attention; the school bully is always on hand to 'pound' him; Susie, the little girl from down the road, often gets her own back on her snowball-throwing nemesis. Calvin's dad is a particularly funny creation: long-suffering, anti-media, and a proponent of fresh air, he also manages to get his revenge on his manic son by tying him up in mental knots with spurious bits of information . All these ingredients would, in the right hands, combine to make a perfectly good comic strip, but what always put Calvin and Hobbes ahead of the competition was the sheer artistry of Watterson's illustrations. In this regard, the chronological arrangement of the strips usefully shows Watterson's increasingly sophisticated technique, from his drawings of desert canyons and hideous inhabitants of alien planets, to the facial expressions of all his characters. It is hard to deny that Watterson owes a debt to Charles Schulz, whose Peanuts strip also offered a sophisticated yet deceptively simple evocation of the inner lives of children. For Calvin and Hobbes, however, Watterson combined uncanny ability, more than a touch of surrealism and a huge dose of humour to distil the essence of late-twentieth-century childhood, thereby elevating his strip into a league of its own.

On the eve of battle, Sir Thomas Lemuel Hawke of Cornwall writes a letter to his children. It is a guide on how to live well, like a knight: staying wise, humble, courageous, loving and kind.

Inside, an editorâs note talks about the discovery of the âhistoricalâ letter, confirming Sir Thomas's death at the Battle of Slaughter Bridge in 1483.It all gives the book an important and timeless feel. Hawke has a way with a sentence, and many of the sections read like note-perfect proverbs. There are also some lovely, tender scenes with the grandfather.

This extraordinary graphic novel is so obviously a labour of love that the reader can only marvel at the energy that has been expended in its creation. Although the two plots that make up the book are essentially simple, the care with which Ware has executed them gives them an almost mythic quality. Jimmy Corrigan is a lonely, single, thirty-something with a boring job in an office cubicle, and a domineering mother who, in spite of living in a nursing home, is never far from the telephone or Jimmy. His crippling shyness renders him incapable of even saying hello to Peggy, the woman who works at an adjacent desk. When the father he has never known sends him an invitation and a plane ticket, Jimmy feels compelled to fly out to meet him. Jimmy's trip is mirrored by the boyhood tale of his grandfather, James, whose relationship with his father is tainted by unhappiness. Young James's mother has died, leaving his father with the unwanted job of bringing up the little boy alone, while at the same time maintaining his job as a glazier at the 1892 Chicago World's Fair. James is a frightened little boy, cowed by his father and bullied at school; he has a vagueness and fragility common to young, lonely and fearful children, qualities that are inherited generations later by his grandson. Chris Ware's illustrations are simply awe-inspiring in the true sense of the word. It is hard to believe that someone could put so much detail into each of the 380 pages that make up this incredible book, but there is a clue to his devotion in the afterword. After spending most of his life avoiding his own father, speaking only rarely on the phone, Ware finally met up with him: 'Gradually, the sublime outrageousness of our evening eroded into two people simply running out of things to say to each other. We weren't father and son anymore, just a pair of regretful men.'

Suzy Smith is very surprised when a huge magical train takes a shortcut through her downstairs hallway one evening. Staffed by trolls, the Impossible Postal Express delivers letters and parcels across a series of magical worlds connected to our own: the Union of Impossible Places. Her curiosity getting the better of her, Suzy hitches a ride and becomes the newest postie. But when her first delivery goes disastrously wrong, she's not only caught up in an amazing magical adventure, but the fate of the Union itself rests on her shoulders... Two towers locked in a power struggle, a cursed boy trapped in a snowglobe, warrior statues, wormholes and negotiable gravity are just a few things Suzy encounters on her incredible journey. Knowledge is power in the Impossible Places, but who is telling the whole truth? Suzy has a brilliant scientific mind, but isn't really one for thinking about consequences â she tends more towards jumping now and thinking later, though her heart is definitely in the right place.

Oppel bases his first YA novel on projects in the 1970s which tested the capability of chimpanzees to acquire sign language. His setting, facts, and outcomes closely mirror events then, and we meet thirteen-year old Ben, an only child whose researcher parents adopt a neonate chimp, Zan, and rear him as part of the family. Readers are drawn into the tension between the emotional bond which Ben and his mother form with Zan, the demands of the research which dominate the attitude of Ben's more inhibited father, and the increasingly fraught relationship he has with his wife and son. Oppel also examines Benâs teenage angst over his own personal relationships, and the ethics of animal experimentation in this absorbing novel.

Jennifer Niven's deeply compelling and highly successful first teen novel All The Bright Places was very much for an older audience with its themes of depression and suicide. Her new book Holding Up the Universe is suitable for younger teens as well - and just as powerfully written. The book is narrated in turns by Libby, famous for once being 'America's Fattest Teen' and starting high school after years of being home schooled, and Jack, who seems to be one of the popular kids but secretly suffers from Prospagnosia - the inability to recognise the faces of familiar people even those in this own family which is often called 'face blindness'. Their worlds collide in a horribly cruel high school game and an unlikely friendship is formed that leads to something even deeper. Jennifer Niven is a gorgeous writer. Her characters Libby and Jack feel so real that it's almost impossible to believe they don't live and breathe. The author herself struggled with weight issues and anxiety over the years, particularly as a teenager, so this writing comes from the heart. The spotlight on prosopagnosia sheds an interesting light on a little known but not so uncommon condition. The ultimate message is uplifting and positive and one that teenagers everywhere need to hear: be yourself and you deserve to be wanted and loved for who you are.Â

The comic-strip adventures of Calvin, a naughty boy with a philosophical bent, and his soft toy tiger companion Hobbes, delighted readers from 1985 to 1995. The huge achievement of the comic's creator Bill Watterson is celebrated here in this wonderful cloth-bound three-volume box set, which contains in chronological order every Calvin and Hobbes strip. For those who have never experienced the sheer delight of Watterson's creation, here is a brief summary: Calvin is an active and imaginative little boy; his friend Hobbes appears as a stuffed tiger when other people are around, but when the two of them are alone he comes to life and is Calvin's friend and playmate. They live with Calvin's long-suffering parents, who have to cope with his turbulent behaviour. The charm of the strip is multi-faceted. On the one hand, Calvin is a typical six-year-old with a vivid imagination: one minute he is fearless intergalactic traveller Spaceman Spiff, crash-landing on a hostile planet, the next he is a fearsome T-Rex stalking his victim through the Jurassic jungle. He is in thrall to consumerism, hates school, loves making gruesome snowmen, and plays Calvinball, an anarchic game of ever-changing rules. Yet he is also given to philosophising about the big issues of life, ably supported or gently undermined by Hobbes's quietly caustic asides . Here is an outlet for Watterson's deeply-held views about the craziness of the modern world; indeed, the artist himself has always shunned publicity. The strip is also enhanced by its strong cast of supporting characters. Mrs Wormwood the teacher looms over Calvin when he not paying attention; the school bully is always on hand to 'pound' him; Susie, the little girl from down the road, often gets her own back on her snowball-throwing nemesis. Calvin's dad is a particularly funny creation: long-suffering, anti-media, and a proponent of fresh air, he also manages to get his revenge on his manic son by tying him up in mental knots with spurious bits of information . All these ingredients would, in the right hands, combine to make a perfectly good comic strip, but what always put Calvin and Hobbes ahead of the competition was the sheer artistry of Watterson's illustrations. In this regard, the chronological arrangement of the strips usefully shows Watterson's increasingly sophisticated technique, from his drawings of desert canyons and hideous inhabitants of alien planets, to the facial expressions of all his characters. It is hard to deny that Watterson owes a debt to Charles Schulz, whose Peanuts strip also offered a sophisticated yet deceptively simple evocation of the inner lives of children. For Calvin and Hobbes, however, Watterson combined uncanny ability, more than a touch of surrealism and a huge dose of humour to distil the essence of late-twentieth-century childhood, thereby elevating his strip into a league of its own.

This extraordinary graphic novel is so obviously a labour of love that the reader can only marvel at the energy that has been expended in its creation. Although the two plots that make up the book are essentially simple, the care with which Ware has executed them gives them an almost mythic quality. Jimmy Corrigan is a lonely, single, thirty-something with a boring job in an office cubicle, and a domineering mother who, in spite of living in a nursing home, is never far from the telephone or Jimmy. His crippling shyness renders him incapable of even saying hello to Peggy, the woman who works at an adjacent desk. When the father he has never known sends him an invitation and a plane ticket, Jimmy feels compelled to fly out to meet him. Jimmy's trip is mirrored by the boyhood tale of his grandfather, James, whose relationship with his father is tainted by unhappiness. Young James's mother has died, leaving his father with the unwanted job of bringing up the little boy alone, while at the same time maintaining his job as a glazier at the 1892 Chicago World's Fair. James is a frightened little boy, cowed by his father and bullied at school; he has a vagueness and fragility common to young, lonely and fearful children, qualities that are inherited generations later by his grandson. Chris Ware's illustrations are simply awe-inspiring in the true sense of the word. It is hard to believe that someone could put so much detail into each of the 380 pages that make up this incredible book, but there is a clue to his devotion in the afterword. After spending most of his life avoiding his own father, speaking only rarely on the phone, Ware finally met up with him: 'Gradually, the sublime outrageousness of our evening eroded into two people simply running out of things to say to each other. We weren't father and son anymore, just a pair of regretful men.'

Suzy has a brilliant scientific mind, but isn't really one for thinking about consequences â she tends more towards jumping now and thinking later, though her heart is definitely in the right place. This roller-coaster of a book is pacey, fun, and full of lots of fantastical new ideas.

Oppel bases his first YA novel on projects in the 1970s which tested the capability of chimpanzees to acquire sign language. His setting, facts, and outcomes closely mirror events then, and we meet thirteen-year old Ben, an only child whose researcher parents adopt a neonate chimp, Zan, and rear him as part of the family. Readers are drawn into the tension between the emotional bond which Ben and his mother form with Zan, the demands of the research which dominate the attitude of Ben's more inhibited father, and the increasingly fraught relationship he has with his wife and son. Oppel also examines Benâs teenage angst over his own personal relationships, and the ethics of animal experimentation in this absorbing novel.

Jennifer Niven's deeply compelling and highly successful first teen novel All The Bright Places was very much for an older audience with its themes of depression and suicide. Her new book Holding Up the Universe is suitable for younger teens as well - and just as powerfully written. The book is narrated in turns by Libby, famous for once being 'America's Fattest Teen' and starting high school after years of being home schooled, and Jack, who seems to be one of the popular kids but secretly suffers from Prospagnosia - the inability to recognise the faces of familiar people even those in this own family which is often called 'face blindness'. Their worlds collide in a horribly cruel high school game and an unlikely friendship is formed that leads to something even deeper. Jennifer Niven is a gorgeous writer. Her characters Libby and Jack feel so real that it's almost impossible to believe they don't live and breathe. The author herself struggled with weight issues and anxiety over the years, particularly as a teenager, so this writing comes from the heart. The spotlight on prosopagnosia sheds an interesting light on a little known but not so uncommon condition. The ultimate message is uplifting and positive and one that teenagers everywhere need to hear: be yourself and you deserve to be wanted and loved for who you are.Â

The comic-strip adventures of Calvin, a naughty boy with a philosophical bent, and his soft toy tiger companion Hobbes, delighted readers from 1985 to 1995. The huge achievement of the comic's creator Bill Watterson is celebrated here in this wonderful cloth-bound three-volume box set, which contains in chronological order every Calvin and Hobbes strip. For those who have never experienced the sheer delight of Watterson's creation, here is a brief summary: Calvin is an active and imaginative little boy; his friend Hobbes appears as a stuffed tiger when other people are around, but when the two of them are alone he comes to life and is Calvin's friend and playmate. They live with Calvin's long-suffering parents, who have to cope with his turbulent behaviour. The charm of the strip is multi-faceted. On the one hand, Calvin is a typical six-year-old with a vivid imagination: one minute he is fearless intergalactic traveller Spaceman Spiff, crash-landing on a hostile planet, the next he is a fearsome T-Rex stalking his victim through the Jurassic jungle. He is in thrall to consumerism, hates school, loves making gruesome snowmen, and plays Calvinball, an anarchic game of ever-changing rules. Yet he is also given to philosophising about the big issues of life, ably supported or gently undermined by Hobbes's quietly caustic asides . Here is an outlet for Watterson's deeply-held views about the craziness of the modern world; indeed, the artist himself has always shunned publicity. The strip is also enhanced by its strong cast of supporting characters. Mrs Wormwood the teacher looms over Calvin when he not paying attention; the school bully is always on hand to 'pound' him; Susie, the little girl from down the road, often gets her own back on her snowball-throwing nemesis. Calvin's dad is a particularly funny creation: long-suffering, anti-media, and a proponent of fresh air, he also manages to get his revenge on his manic son by tying him up in mental knots with spurious bits of information . All these ingredients would, in the right hands, combine to make a perfectly good comic strip, but what always put Calvin and Hobbes ahead of the competition was the sheer artistry of Watterson's illustrations. In this regard, the chronological arrangement of the strips usefully shows Watterson's increasingly sophisticated technique, from his drawings of desert canyons and hideous inhabitants of alien planets, to the facial expressions of all his characters. It is hard to deny that Watterson owes a debt to Charles Schulz, whose Peanuts strip also offered a sophisticated yet deceptively simple evocation of the inner lives of children. For Calvin and Hobbes, however, Watterson combined uncanny ability, more than a touch of surrealism and a huge dose of humour to distil the essence of late-twentieth-century childhood, thereby elevating his strip into a league of its own.

This extraordinary graphic novel is so obviously a labour of love that the reader can only marvel at the energy that has been expended in its creation. Although the two plots that make up the book are essentially simple, the care with which Ware has executed them gives them an almost mythic quality. Jimmy Corrigan is a lonely, single, thirty-something with a boring job in an office cubicle, and a domineering mother who, in spite of living in a nursing home, is never far from the telephone or Jimmy. His crippling shyness renders him incapable of even saying hello to Peggy, the woman who works at an adjacent desk. When the father he has never known sends him an invitation and a plane ticket, Jimmy feels compelled to fly out to meet him. Jimmy's trip is mirrored by the boyhood tale of his grandfather, James, whose relationship with his father is tainted by unhappiness. Young James's mother has died, leaving his father with the unwanted job of bringing up the little boy alone, while at the same time maintaining his job as a glazier at the 1892 Chicago World's Fair. James is a frightened little boy, cowed by his father and bullied at school; he has a vagueness and fragility common to young, lonely and fearful children, qualities that are inherited generations later by his grandson. Chris Ware's illustrations are simply awe-inspiring in the true sense of the word. It is hard to believe that someone could put so much detail into each of the 380 pages that make up this incredible book, but there is a clue to his devotion in the afterword. After spending most of his life avoiding his own father, speaking only rarely on the phone, Ware finally met up with him: 'Gradually, the sublime outrageousness of our evening eroded into two people simply running out of things to say to each other. We weren't father and son anymore, just a pair of regretful men.'

Oppel also examines Benâs teenage angst over his own personal relationships, and the ethics of animal experimentation in this absorbing novel.

Jennifer Niven's deeply compelling and highly successful first teen novel All The Bright Places was very much for an older audience with its themes of depression and suicide. Her new book Holding Up the Universe is suitable for younger teens as well - and just as powerfully written. The book is narrated in turns by Libby, famous for once being 'America's Fattest Teen' and starting high school after years of being home schooled, and Jack, who seems to be one of the popular kids but secretly suffers from Prospagnosia - the inability to recognise the faces of familiar people even those in this own family which is often called 'face blindness'. Their worlds collide in a horribly cruel high school game and an unlikely friendship is formed that leads to something even deeper. Jennifer Niven is a gorgeous writer. Her characters Libby and Jack feel so real that it's almost impossible to believe they don't live and breathe. The author herself struggled with weight issues and anxiety over the years, particularly as a teenager, so this writing comes from the heart. The spotlight on prosopagnosia sheds an interesting light on a little known but not so uncommon condition. The ultimate message is uplifting and positive and one that teenagers everywhere need to hear: be yourself and you deserve to be wanted and loved for who you are.Â

The comic-strip adventures of Calvin, a naughty boy with a philosophical bent, and his soft toy tiger companion Hobbes, delighted readers from 1985 to 1995. The huge achievement of the comic's creator Bill Watterson is celebrated here in this wonderful cloth-bound three-volume box set, which contains in chronological order every Calvin and Hobbes strip. For those who have never experienced the sheer delight of Watterson's creation, here is a brief summary: Calvin is an active and imaginative little boy; his friend Hobbes appears as a stuffed tiger when other people are around, but when the two of them are alone he comes to life and is Calvin's friend and playmate. They live with Calvin's long-suffering parents, who have to cope with his turbulent behaviour. The charm of the strip is multi-faceted. On the one hand, Calvin is a typical six-year-old with a vivid imagination: one minute he is fearless intergalactic traveller Spaceman Spiff, crash-landing on a hostile planet, the next he is a fearsome T-Rex stalking his victim through the Jurassic jungle. He is in thrall to consumerism, hates school, loves making gruesome snowmen, and plays Calvinball, an anarchic game of ever-changing rules. Yet he is also given to philosophising about the big issues of life, ably supported or gently undermined by Hobbes's quietly caustic asides . Here is an outlet for Watterson's deeply-held views about the craziness of the modern world; indeed, the artist himself has always shunned publicity. The strip is also enhanced by its strong cast of supporting characters. Mrs Wormwood the teacher looms over Calvin when he not paying attention; the school bully is always on hand to 'pound' him; Susie, the little girl from down the road, often gets her own back on her snowball-throwing nemesis. Calvin's dad is a particularly funny creation: long-suffering, anti-media, and a proponent of fresh air, he also manages to get his revenge on his manic son by tying him up in mental knots with spurious bits of information . All these ingredients would, in the right hands, combine to make a perfectly good comic strip, but what always put Calvin and Hobbes ahead of the competition was the sheer artistry of Watterson's illustrations. In this regard, the chronological arrangement of the strips usefully shows Watterson's increasingly sophisticated technique, from his drawings of desert canyons and hideous inhabitants of alien planets, to the facial expressions of all his characters. It is hard to deny that Watterson owes a debt to Charles Schulz, whose Peanuts strip also offered a sophisticated yet deceptively simple evocation of the inner lives of children. For Calvin and Hobbes, however, Watterson combined uncanny ability, more than a touch of surrealism and a huge dose of humour to distil the essence of late-twentieth-century childhood, thereby elevating his strip into a league of its own.

This extraordinary graphic novel is so obviously a labour of love that the reader can only marvel at the energy that has been expended in its creation. Although the two plots that make up the book are essentially simple, the care with which Ware has executed them gives them an almost mythic quality. Jimmy Corrigan is a lonely, single, thirty-something with a boring job in an office cubicle, and a domineering mother who, in spite of living in a nursing home, is never far from the telephone or Jimmy. His crippling shyness renders him incapable of even saying hello to Peggy, the woman who works at an adjacent desk. When the father he has never known sends him an invitation and a plane ticket, Jimmy feels compelled to fly out to meet him. Jimmy's trip is mirrored by the boyhood tale of his grandfather, James, whose relationship with his father is tainted by unhappiness. Young James's mother has died, leaving his father with the unwanted job of bringing up the little boy alone, while at the same time maintaining his job as a glazier at the 1892 Chicago World's Fair. James is a frightened little boy, cowed by his father and bullied at school; he has a vagueness and fragility common to young, lonely and fearful children, qualities that are inherited generations later by his grandson. Chris Ware's illustrations are simply awe-inspiring in the true sense of the word. It is hard to believe that someone could put so much detail into each of the 380 pages that make up this incredible book, but there is a clue to his devotion in the afterword. After spending most of his life avoiding his own father, speaking only rarely on the phone, Ware finally met up with him: 'Gradually, the sublime outrageousness of our evening eroded into two people simply running out of things to say to each other. We weren't father and son anymore, just a pair of regretful men.'

Jennifer Niven's deeply compelling and highly successful first teen novel All The Bright Places was very much for an older audience with its themes of depression and suicide. Her new book Holding Up the Universe is suitable for younger teens as well - and just as powerfully written.

Their worlds collide in a horribly cruel high school game and an unlikely friendship is formed that leads to something even deeper. Jennifer Niven is a gorgeous writer. Her characters Libby and Jack feel so real that it's almost impossible to believe they don't live and breathe. The author herself struggled with weight issues and anxiety over the years, particularly as a teenager, so this writing comes from the heart. The spotlight on prosopagnosia sheds an interesting light on a little known but not so uncommon condition. The ultimate message is uplifting and positive and one that teenagers everywhere need to hear: be yourself and you deserve to be wanted and loved for who you are.Â

The comic-strip adventures of Calvin, a naughty boy with a philosophical bent, and his soft toy tiger companion Hobbes, delighted readers from 1985 to 1995. The huge achievement of the comic's creator Bill Watterson is celebrated here in this wonderful cloth-bound three-volume box set, which contains in chronological order every Calvin and Hobbes strip. For those who have never experienced the sheer delight of Watterson's creation, here is a brief summary: Calvin is an active and imaginative little boy; his friend Hobbes appears as a stuffed tiger when other people are around, but when the two of them are alone he comes to life and is Calvin's friend and playmate. They live with Calvin's long-suffering parents, who have to cope with his turbulent behaviour. The charm of the strip is multi-faceted. On the one hand, Calvin is a typical six-year-old with a vivid imagination: one minute he is fearless intergalactic traveller Spaceman Spiff, crash-landing on a hostile planet, the next he is a fearsome T-Rex stalking his victim through the Jurassic jungle. He is in thrall to consumerism, hates school, loves making gruesome snowmen, and plays Calvinball, an anarchic game of ever-changing rules. Yet he is also given to philosophising about the big issues of life, ably supported or gently undermined by Hobbes's quietly caustic asides . Here is an outlet for Watterson's deeply-held views about the craziness of the modern world; indeed, the artist himself has always shunned publicity. The strip is also enhanced by its strong cast of supporting characters. Mrs Wormwood the teacher looms over Calvin when he not paying attention; the school bully is always on hand to 'pound' him; Susie, the little girl from down the road, often gets her own back on her snowball-throwing nemesis. Calvin's dad is a particularly funny creation: long-suffering, anti-media, and a proponent of fresh air, he also manages to get his revenge on his manic son by tying him up in mental knots with spurious bits of information . All these ingredients would, in the right hands, combine to make a perfectly good comic strip, but what always put Calvin and Hobbes ahead of the competition was the sheer artistry of Watterson's illustrations. In this regard, the chronological arrangement of the strips usefully shows Watterson's increasingly sophisticated technique, from his drawings of desert canyons and hideous inhabitants of alien planets, to the facial expressions of all his characters. It is hard to deny that Watterson owes a debt to Charles Schulz, whose Peanuts strip also offered a sophisticated yet deceptively simple evocation of the inner lives of children. For Calvin and Hobbes, however, Watterson combined uncanny ability, more than a touch of surrealism and a huge dose of humour to distil the essence of late-twentieth-century childhood, thereby elevating his strip into a league of its own.

This extraordinary graphic novel is so obviously a labour of love that the reader can only marvel at the energy that has been expended in its creation. Although the two plots that make up the book are essentially simple, the care with which Ware has executed them gives them an almost mythic quality. Jimmy Corrigan is a lonely, single, thirty-something with a boring job in an office cubicle, and a domineering mother who, in spite of living in a nursing home, is never far from the telephone or Jimmy. His crippling shyness renders him incapable of even saying hello to Peggy, the woman who works at an adjacent desk. When the father he has never known sends him an invitation and a plane ticket, Jimmy feels compelled to fly out to meet him. Jimmy's trip is mirrored by the boyhood tale of his grandfather, James, whose relationship with his father is tainted by unhappiness. Young James's mother has died, leaving his father with the unwanted job of bringing up the little boy alone, while at the same time maintaining his job as a glazier at the 1892 Chicago World's Fair. James is a frightened little boy, cowed by his father and bullied at school; he has a vagueness and fragility common to young, lonely and fearful children, qualities that are inherited generations later by his grandson. Chris Ware's illustrations are simply awe-inspiring in the true sense of the word. It is hard to believe that someone could put so much detail into each of the 380 pages that make up this incredible book, but there is a clue to his devotion in the afterword. After spending most of his life avoiding his own father, speaking only rarely on the phone, Ware finally met up with him: 'Gradually, the sublime outrageousness of our evening eroded into two people simply running out of things to say to each other. We weren't father and son anymore, just a pair of regretful men.'

Jennifer Niven's deeply compelling and highly successful first teen novel All The Bright Places was very much for an older audience with its themes of depression and suicide. Her new book Holding Up the Universe is suitable for younger teens as well - and just as powerfully written. The book is narrated in turns by Libby, famous for once being 'America's Fattest Teen' and starting high school after years of being home schooled, and Jack, who seems to be one of the popular kids but secretly suffers from Prospagnosia - the inability to recognise the faces of familiar people even those in this own family which is often called 'face blindness'. Their worlds collide in a horribly cruel high school game and an unlikely friendship is formed that leads to something even deeper. Jennifer Niven is a gorgeous writer. Her characters Libby and Jack feel so real that it's almost impossible to believe they don't live and breathe. The author herself struggled with weight issues and anxiety over the years, particularly as a teenager, so this writing comes from the heart. The spotlight on prosopagnosia sheds an interesting light on a little known but not so uncommon condition.

The comic-strip adventures of Calvin, a naughty boy with a philosophical bent, and his soft toy tiger companion Hobbes, delighted readers from 1985 to 1995. The huge achievement of the comic's creator Bill Watterson is celebrated here in this wonderful cloth-bound three-volume box set, which contains in chronological order every Calvin and Hobbes strip. For those who have never experienced the sheer delight of Watterson's creation, here is a brief summary: Calvin is an active and imaginative little boy; his friend Hobbes appears as a stuffed tiger when other people are around, but when the two of them are alone he comes to life and is Calvin's friend and playmate. They live with Calvin's long-suffering parents, who have to cope with his turbulent behaviour. The charm of the strip is multi-faceted. On the one hand, Calvin is a typical six-year-old with a vivid imagination: one minute he is fearless intergalactic traveller Spaceman Spiff, crash-landing on a hostile planet, the next he is a fearsome T-Rex stalking his victim through the Jurassic jungle. He is in thrall to consumerism, hates school, loves making gruesome snowmen, and plays Calvinball, an anarchic game of ever-changing rules. Yet he is also given to philosophising about the big issues of life, ably supported or gently undermined by Hobbes's quietly caustic asides . Here is an outlet for Watterson's deeply-held views about the craziness of the modern world; indeed, the artist himself has always shunned publicity. The strip is also enhanced by its strong cast of supporting characters. Mrs Wormwood the teacher looms over Calvin when he not paying attention; the school bully is always on hand to 'pound' him; Susie, the little girl from down the road, often gets her own back on her snowball-throwing nemesis. Calvin's dad is a particularly funny creation: long-suffering, anti-media, and a proponent of fresh air, he also manages to get his revenge on his manic son by tying him up in mental knots with spurious bits of information . All these ingredients would, in the right hands, combine to make a perfectly good comic strip, but what always put Calvin and Hobbes ahead of the competition was the sheer artistry of Watterson's illustrations. In this regard, the chronological arrangement of the strips usefully shows Watterson's increasingly sophisticated technique, from his drawings of desert canyons and hideous inhabitants of alien planets, to the facial expressions of all his characters. It is hard to deny that Watterson owes a debt to Charles Schulz, whose Peanuts strip also offered a sophisticated yet deceptively simple evocation of the inner lives of children. For Calvin and Hobbes, however, Watterson combined uncanny ability, more than a touch of surrealism and a huge dose of humour to distil the essence of late-twentieth-century childhood, thereby elevating his strip into a league of its own.

This extraordinary graphic novel is so obviously a labour of love that the reader can only marvel at the energy that has been expended in its creation. Although the two plots that make up the book are essentially simple, the care with which Ware has executed them gives them an almost mythic quality. Jimmy Corrigan is a lonely, single, thirty-something with a boring job in an office cubicle, and a domineering mother who, in spite of living in a nursing home, is never far from the telephone or Jimmy. His crippling shyness renders him incapable of even saying hello to Peggy, the woman who works at an adjacent desk. When the father he has never known sends him an invitation and a plane ticket, Jimmy feels compelled to fly out to meet him. Jimmy's trip is mirrored by the boyhood tale of his grandfather, James, whose relationship with his father is tainted by unhappiness. Young James's mother has died, leaving his father with the unwanted job of bringing up the little boy alone, while at the same time maintaining his job as a glazier at the 1892 Chicago World's Fair. James is a frightened little boy, cowed by his father and bullied at school; he has a vagueness and fragility common to young, lonely and fearful children, qualities that are inherited generations later by his grandson. Chris Ware's illustrations are simply awe-inspiring in the true sense of the word. It is hard to believe that someone could put so much detail into each of the 380 pages that make up this incredible book, but there is a clue to his devotion in the afterword. After spending most of his life avoiding his own father, speaking only rarely on the phone, Ware finally met up with him: 'Gradually, the sublime outrageousness of our evening eroded into two people simply running out of things to say to each other. We weren't father and son anymore, just a pair of regretful men.'

Jennifer Niven's deeply compelling and highly successful first teen novel All The Bright Places was very much for an older audience with its themes of depression and suicide. Her new book Holding Up the Universe is suitable for younger teens as well - and just as powerfully written. The book is narrated in turns by Libby, famous for once being 'America's Fattest Teen' and starting high school after years of being home schooled, and Jack, who seems to be one of the popular kids but secretly suffers from Prospagnosia - the inability to recognise the faces of familiar people even those in this own family which is often called 'face blindness'. Their worlds collide in a horribly cruel high school game and an unlikely friendship is formed that leads to something even deeper. Jennifer Niven is a gorgeous writer. Her characters Libby and Jack feel so real that it's almost impossible to believe they don't live and breathe. The author herself struggled with weight issues and anxiety over the years, particularly as a teenager, so this writing comes from the heart. The spotlight on prosopagnosia sheds an interesting light on a little known but not so uncommon condition. The ultimate message is uplifting and positive and one that teenagers everywhere need to hear: be yourself and you deserve to be wanted and loved for who you are.Â

The comic-strip adventures of Calvin, a naughty boy with a philosophical bent, and his soft toy tiger companion Hobbes, delighted readers from 1985 to 1995. The huge achievement of the comic's creator Bill Watterson is celebrated here in this wonderful cloth-bound three-volume box set, which contains in chronological order every Calvin and Hobbes strip. For those who have never experienced the sheer delight of Watterson's creation, here is a brief summary: Calvin is an active and imaginative little boy; his friend Hobbes appears as a stuffed tiger when other people are around, but when the two of them are alone he comes to life and is Calvin's friend and playmate. They live with Calvin's long-suffering parents, who have to cope with his turbulent behaviour. The charm of the strip is multi-faceted. On the one hand, Calvin is a typical six-year-old with a vivid imagination: one minute he is fearless intergalactic traveller Spaceman Spiff, crash-landing on a hostile planet, the next he is a fearsome T-Rex stalking his victim through the Jurassic jungle. He is in thrall to consumerism, hates school, loves making gruesome snowmen, and plays Calvinball, an anarchic game of ever-changing rules. Yet he is also given to philosophising about the big issues of life, ably supported or gently undermined by Hobbes's quietly caustic asides . Here is an outlet for Watterson's deeply-held views about the craziness of the modern world; indeed, the artist himself has always shunned publicity. The strip is also enhanced by its strong cast of supporting characters. Mrs Wormwood the teacher looms over Calvin when he not paying attention; the school bully is always on hand to 'pound' him; Susie, the little girl from down the road, often gets her own back on her snowball-throwing nemesis. Calvin's dad is a particularly funny creation: long-suffering, anti-media, and a proponent of fresh air, he also manages to get his revenge on his manic son by tying him up in mental knots with spurious bits of information . All these ingredients would, in the right hands, combine to make a perfectly good comic strip, but what always put Calvin and Hobbes ahead of the competition was the sheer artistry of Watterson's illustrations. In this regard, the chronological arrangement of the strips usefully shows Watterson's increasingly sophisticated technique, from his drawings of desert canyons and hideous inhabitants of alien planets, to the facial expressions of all his characters. It is hard to deny that Watterson owes a debt to Charles Schulz, whose Peanuts strip also offered a sophisticated yet deceptively simple evocation of the inner lives of children. For Calvin and Hobbes, however, Watterson combined uncanny ability, more than a touch of surrealism and a huge dose of humour to distil the essence of late-twentieth-century childhood, thereby elevating his strip into a league of its own.

This extraordinary graphic novel is so obviously a labour of love that the reader can only marvel at the energy that has been expended in its creation. Although the two plots that make up the book are essentially simple, the care with which Ware has executed them gives them an almost mythic quality. Jimmy Corrigan is a lonely, single, thirty-something with a boring job in an office cubicle, and a domineering mother who, in spite of living in a nursing home, is never far from the telephone or Jimmy. His crippling shyness renders him incapable of even saying hello to Peggy, the woman who works at an adjacent desk. When the father he has never known sends him an invitation and a plane ticket, Jimmy feels compelled to fly out to meet him. Jimmy's trip is mirrored by the boyhood tale of his grandfather, James, whose relationship with his father is tainted by unhappiness. Young James's mother has died, leaving his father with the unwanted job of bringing up the little boy alone, while at the same time maintaining his job as a glazier at the 1892 Chicago World's Fair. James is a frightened little boy, cowed by his father and bullied at school; he has a vagueness and fragility common to young, lonely and fearful children, qualities that are inherited generations later by his grandson. Chris Ware's illustrations are simply awe-inspiring in the true sense of the word. It is hard to believe that someone could put so much detail into each of the 380 pages that make up this incredible book, but there is a clue to his devotion in the afterword. After spending most of his life avoiding his own father, speaking only rarely on the phone, Ware finally met up with him: 'Gradually, the sublime outrageousness of our evening eroded into two people simply running out of things to say to each other. We weren't father and son anymore, just a pair of regretful men.'

Jennifer Niven's deeply compelling and highly successful first teen novel All The Bright Places was very much for an older audience with its themes of depression and suicide. Her new book Holding Up the Universe is suitable for younger teens as well - and just as powerfully written. The book is narrated in turns by Libby, famous for once being 'America's Fattest Teen' and starting high school after years of being home schooled, and Jack, who seems to be one of the popular kids but secretly suffers from Prospagnosia - the inability to recognise the faces of familiar people even those in this own family which is often called 'face blindness'. Their worlds collide in a horribly cruel high school game and an unlikely friendship is formed that leads to something even deeper. Jennifer Niven is a gorgeous writer. Her characters Libby and Jack feel so real that it's almost impossible to believe they don't live and breathe. The author herself struggled with weight issues and anxiety over the years, particularly as a teenager, so this writing comes from the heart. The spotlight on prosopagnosia sheds an interesting light on a little known but not so uncommon condition. The ultimate message is uplifting and positive and one that teenagers everywhere need to hear: be yourself and you deserve to be wanted and loved for who you are.Â

On the eve of battle, Sir Thomas Lemuel Hawke of Cornwall writes a letter to his children. It is a guide on how to live well, like a knight: staying wise, humble, courageous, loving and kind. Hawke has tried to make this book look as authentic as possible. The cover stands out with a gold-embossed leaf. Inside, an editorâs note talks about the discovery of the âhistoricalâ letter, confirming Sir Thomas's death at the Battle of Slaughter Bridge in 1483.It all gives the book an important and timeless feel. Hawke has a way with a sentence, and many of the sections read like note-perfect proverbs. There are also some lovely, tender scenes with the grandfather. It can be a little dense at times, so children may want to dip in and out of the short, standalone chapters.

This extraordinary graphic novel is so obviously a labour of love that the reader can only marvel at the energy that has been expended in its creation. Although the two plots that make up the book are essentially simple, the care with which Ware has executed them gives them an almost mythic quality. Jimmy Corrigan is a lonely, single, thirty-something with a boring job in an office cubicle, and a domineering mother who, in spite of living in a nursing home, is never far from the telephone or Jimmy. His crippling shyness renders him incapable of even saying hello to Peggy, the woman who works at an adjacent desk. When the father he has never known sends him an invitation and a plane ticket, Jimmy feels compelled to fly out to meet him. Jimmy's trip is mirrored by the boyhood tale of his grandfather, James, whose relationship with his father is tainted by unhappiness. Young James's mother has died, leaving his father with the unwanted job of bringing up the little boy alone, while at the same time maintaining his job as a glazier at the 1892 Chicago World's Fair. James is a frightened little boy, cowed by his father and bullied at school; he has a vagueness and fragility common to young, lonely and fearful children, qualities that are inherited generations later by his grandson. Chris Ware's illustrations are simply awe-inspiring in the true sense of the word. It is hard to believe that someone could put so much detail into each of the 380 pages that make up this incredible book, but there is a clue to his devotion in the afterword. After spending most of his life avoiding his own father, speaking only rarely on the phone, Ware finally met up with him: 'Gradually, the sublime outrageousness of our evening eroded into two people simply running out of things to say to each other. We weren't father and son anymore, just a pair of regretful men.'

Jennifer Niven's deeply compelling and highly successful first teen novel All The Bright Places was very much for an older audience with its themes of depression and suicide. Her new book Holding Up the Universe is suitable for younger teens as well - and just as powerfully written. The book is narrated in turns by Libby, famous for once being 'America's Fattest Teen' and starting high school after years of being home schooled, and Jack, who seems to be one of the popular kids but secretly suffers from Prospagnosia - the inability to recognise the faces of familiar people even those in this own family which is often called 'face blindness'. Their worlds collide in a horribly cruel high school game and an unlikely friendship is formed that leads to something even deeper. Jennifer Niven is a gorgeous writer. Her characters Libby and Jack feel so real that it's almost impossible to believe they don't live and breathe. The author herself struggled with weight issues and anxiety over the years, particularly as a teenager, so this writing comes from the heart. The spotlight on prosopagnosia sheds an interesting light on a little known but not so uncommon condition. The ultimate message is uplifting and positive and one that teenagers everywhere need to hear: be yourself and you deserve to be wanted and loved for who you are.Â

The comic-strip adventures of Calvin, a naughty boy with a philosophical bent, and his soft toy tiger companion Hobbes, delighted readers from 1985 to 1995. The huge achievement of the comic's creator Bill Watterson is celebrated here in this wonderful cloth-bound three-volume box set, which contains in chronological order every Calvin and Hobbes strip. For those who have never experienced the sheer delight of Watterson's creation, here is a brief summary: Calvin is an active and imaginative little boy; his friend Hobbes appears as a stuffed tiger when other people are around, but when the two of them are alone he comes to life and is Calvin's friend and playmate. They live with Calvin's long-suffering parents, who have to cope with his turbulent behaviour. The charm of the strip is multi-faceted. On the one hand, Calvin is a typical six-year-old with a vivid imagination: one minute he is fearless intergalactic traveller Spaceman Spiff, crash-landing on a hostile planet, the next he is a fearsome T-Rex stalking his victim through the Jurassic jungle. He is in thrall to consumerism, hates school, loves making gruesome snowmen, and plays Calvinball, an anarchic game of ever-changing rules. Yet he is also given to philosophising about the big issues of life, ably supported or gently undermined by Hobbes's quietly caustic asides . Here is an outlet for Watterson's deeply-held views about the craziness of the modern world; indeed, the artist himself has always shunned publicity. The strip is also enhanced by its strong cast of supporting characters. Mrs Wormwood the teacher looms over Calvin when he not paying attention; the school bully is always on hand to 'pound' him; Susie, the little girl from down the road, often gets her own back on her snowball-throwing nemesis. Calvin's dad is a particularly funny creation: long-suffering, anti-media, and a proponent of fresh air, he also manages to get his revenge on his manic son by tying him up in mental knots with spurious bits of information . All these ingredients would, in the right hands, combine to make a perfectly good comic strip, but what always put Calvin and Hobbes ahead of the competition was the sheer artistry of Watterson's illustrations. In this regard, the chronological arrangement of the strips usefully shows Watterson's increasingly sophisticated technique, from his drawings of desert canyons and hideous inhabitants of alien planets, to the facial expressions of all his characters. It is hard to deny that Watterson owes a debt to Charles Schulz, whose Peanuts strip also offered a sophisticated yet deceptively simple evocation of the inner lives of children. For Calvin and Hobbes, however, Watterson combined uncanny ability, more than a touch of surrealism and a huge dose of humour to distil the essence of late-twentieth-century childhood, thereby elevating his strip into a league of its own.

On the eve of battle, Sir Thomas Lemuel Hawke of Cornwall writes a letter to his children. It is a guide on how to live well, like a knight: staying wise, humble, courageous, loving and kind. Hawke has tried to make this book look as authentic as possible. The cover stands out with a gold-embossed leaf. Inside, an editorâs note talks about the discovery of the âhistoricalâ letter, confirming Sir Thomas's death at the Battle of Slaughter Bridge in 1483.It all gives the book an important and timeless feel. Hawke has a way with a sentence, and many of the sections read like note-perfect proverbs. There are also some lovely, tender scenes with the grandfather. It can be a little dense at times, so children may want to dip in and out of the short, standalone chapters. But the book is pitched in such a way that they can get new meaning from it as they grow into teenagers and young adults.

This extraordinary graphic novel is so obviously a labour of love that the reader can only marvel at the energy that has been expended in its creation. Although the two plots that make up the book are essentially simple, the care with which Ware has executed them gives them an almost mythic quality. Jimmy Corrigan is a lonely, single, thirty-something with a boring job in an office cubicle, and a domineering mother who, in spite of living in a nursing home, is never far from the telephone or Jimmy. His crippling shyness renders him incapable of even saying hello to Peggy, the woman who works at an adjacent desk. When the father he has never known sends him an invitation and a plane ticket, Jimmy feels compelled to fly out to meet him. Jimmy's trip is mirrored by the boyhood tale of his grandfather, James, whose relationship with his father is tainted by unhappiness. Young James's mother has died, leaving his father with the unwanted job of bringing up the little boy alone, while at the same time maintaining his job as a glazier at the 1892 Chicago World's Fair. James is a frightened little boy, cowed by his father and bullied at school; he has a vagueness and fragility common to young, lonely and fearful children, qualities that are inherited generations later by his grandson. Chris Ware's illustrations are simply awe-inspiring in the true sense of the word. It is hard to believe that someone could put so much detail into each of the 380 pages that make up this incredible book, but there is a clue to his devotion in the afterword. After spending most of his life avoiding his own father, speaking only rarely on the phone, Ware finally met up with him: 'Gradually, the sublime outrageousness of our evening eroded into two people simply running out of things to say to each other. We weren't father and son anymore, just a pair of regretful men.'

Kelly Barnhill won the Newbery Medal in the US for this thoughtful and magical book about belonging, fear and family, and itâs easy to see why.

Jennifer Niven's deeply compelling and highly successful first teen novel All The Bright Places was very much for an older audience with its themes of depression and suicide. Her new book Holding Up the Universe is suitable for younger teens as well - and just as powerfully written. The book is narrated in turns by Libby, famous for once being 'America's Fattest Teen' and starting high school after years of being home schooled, and Jack, who seems to be one of the popular kids but secretly suffers from Prospagnosia - the inability to recognise the faces of familiar people even those in this own family which is often called 'face blindness'. Their worlds collide in a horribly cruel high school game and an unlikely friendship is formed that leads to something even deeper. Jennifer Niven is a gorgeous writer. Her characters Libby and Jack feel so real that it's almost impossible to believe they don't live and breathe. The author herself struggled with weight issues and anxiety over the years, particularly as a teenager, so this writing comes from the heart. The spotlight on prosopagnosia sheds an interesting light on a little known but not so uncommon condition. The ultimate message is uplifting and positive and one that teenagers everywhere need to hear: be yourself and you deserve to be wanted and loved for who you are.Â

The comic-strip adventures of Calvin, a naughty boy with a philosophical bent, and his soft toy tiger companion Hobbes, delighted readers from 1985 to 1995. The huge achievement of the comic's creator Bill Watterson is celebrated here in this wonderful cloth-bound three-volume box set, which contains in chronological order every Calvin and Hobbes strip. For those who have never experienced the sheer delight of Watterson's creation, here is a brief summary: Calvin is an active and imaginative little boy; his friend Hobbes appears as a stuffed tiger when other people are around, but when the two of them are alone he comes to life and is Calvin's friend and playmate. They live with Calvin's long-suffering parents, who have to cope with his turbulent behaviour. The charm of the strip is multi-faceted. On the one hand, Calvin is a typical six-year-old with a vivid imagination: one minute he is fearless intergalactic traveller Spaceman Spiff, crash-landing on a hostile planet, the next he is a fearsome T-Rex stalking his victim through the Jurassic jungle. He is in thrall to consumerism, hates school, loves making gruesome snowmen, and plays Calvinball, an anarchic game of ever-changing rules. Yet he is also given to philosophising about the big issues of life, ably supported or gently undermined by Hobbes's quietly caustic asides . Here is an outlet for Watterson's deeply-held views about the craziness of the modern world; indeed, the artist himself has always shunned publicity. The strip is also enhanced by its strong cast of supporting characters. Mrs Wormwood the teacher looms over Calvin when he not paying attention; the school bully is always on hand to 'pound' him; Susie, the little girl from down the road, often gets her own back on her snowball-throwing nemesis. Calvin's dad is a particularly funny creation: long-suffering, anti-media, and a proponent of fresh air, he also manages to get his revenge on his manic son by tying him up in mental knots with spurious bits of information . All these ingredients would, in the right hands, combine to make a perfectly good comic strip, but what always put Calvin and Hobbes ahead of the competition was the sheer artistry of Watterson's illustrations. In this regard, the chronological arrangement of the strips usefully shows Watterson's increasingly sophisticated technique, from his drawings of desert canyons and hideous inhabitants of alien planets, to the facial expressions of all his characters. It is hard to deny that Watterson owes a debt to Charles Schulz, whose Peanuts strip also offered a sophisticated yet deceptively simple evocation of the inner lives of children. For Calvin and Hobbes, however, Watterson combined uncanny ability, more than a touch of surrealism and a huge dose of humour to distil the essence of late-twentieth-century childhood, thereby elevating his strip into a league of its own.

This extraordinary graphic novel is so obviously a labour of love that the reader can only marvel at the energy that has been expended in its creation. Although the two plots that make up the book are essentially simple, the care with which Ware has executed them gives them an almost mythic quality. Jimmy Corrigan is a lonely, single, thirty-something with a boring job in an office cubicle, and a domineering mother who, in spite of living in a nursing home, is never far from the telephone or Jimmy. His crippling shyness renders him incapable of even saying hello to Peggy, the woman who works at an adjacent desk. When the father he has never known sends him an invitation and a plane ticket, Jimmy feels compelled to fly out to meet him. Jimmy's trip is mirrored by the boyhood tale of his grandfather, James, whose relationship with his father is tainted by unhappiness. Young James's mother has died, leaving his father with the unwanted job of bringing up the little boy alone, while at the same time maintaining his job as a glazier at the 1892 Chicago World's Fair. James is a frightened little boy, cowed by his father and bullied at school; he has a vagueness and fragility common to young, lonely and fearful children, qualities that are inherited generations later by his grandson. Chris Ware's illustrations are simply awe-inspiring in the true sense of the word. It is hard to believe that someone could put so much detail into each of the 380 pages that make up this incredible book, but there is a clue to his devotion in the afterword. After spending most of his life avoiding his own father, speaking only rarely on the phone, Ware finally met up with him: 'Gradually, the sublime outrageousness of our evening eroded into two people simply running out of things to say to each other. We weren't father and son anymore, just a pair of regretful men.'

But nothing is straightforward, and when Luna turns 13, everything will change. Kelly Barnhill won the Newbery Medal in the US for this thoughtful and magical book about belonging, fear and family, and itâs easy to see why.

Jennifer Niven's deeply compelling and highly successful first teen novel All The Bright Places was very much for an older audience with its themes of depression and suicide. Her new book Holding Up the Universe is suitable for younger teens as well - and just as powerfully written. The book is narrated in turns by Libby, famous for once being 'America's Fattest Teen' and starting high school after years of being home schooled, and Jack, who seems to be one of the popular kids but secretly suffers from Prospagnosia - the inability to recognise the faces of familiar people even those in this own family which is often called 'face blindness'. Their worlds collide in a horribly cruel high school game and an unlikely friendship is formed that leads to something even deeper. Jennifer Niven is a gorgeous writer. Her characters Libby and Jack feel so real that it's almost impossible to believe they don't live and breathe. The author herself struggled with weight issues and anxiety over the years, particularly as a teenager, so this writing comes from the heart. The spotlight on prosopagnosia sheds an interesting light on a little known but not so uncommon condition. The ultimate message is uplifting and positive and one that teenagers everywhere need to hear: be yourself and you deserve to be wanted and loved for who you are.Â

The comic-strip adventures of Calvin, a naughty boy with a philosophical bent, and his soft toy tiger companion Hobbes, delighted readers from 1985 to 1995. The huge achievement of the comic's creator Bill Watterson is celebrated here in this wonderful cloth-bound three-volume box set, which contains in chronological order every Calvin and Hobbes strip. For those who have never experienced the sheer delight of Watterson's creation, here is a brief summary: Calvin is an active and imaginative little boy; his friend Hobbes appears as a stuffed tiger when other people are around, but when the two of them are alone he comes to life and is Calvin's friend and playmate. They live with Calvin's long-suffering parents, who have to cope with his turbulent behaviour. The charm of the strip is multi-faceted. On the one hand, Calvin is a typical six-year-old with a vivid imagination: one minute he is fearless intergalactic traveller Spaceman Spiff, crash-landing on a hostile planet, the next he is a fearsome T-Rex stalking his victim through the Jurassic jungle. He is in thrall to consumerism, hates school, loves making gruesome snowmen, and plays Calvinball, an anarchic game of ever-changing rules. Yet he is also given to philosophising about the big issues of life, ably supported or gently undermined by Hobbes's quietly caustic asides . Here is an outlet for Watterson's deeply-held views about the craziness of the modern world; indeed, the artist himself has always shunned publicity. The strip is also enhanced by its strong cast of supporting characters. Mrs Wormwood the teacher looms over Calvin when he not paying attention; the school bully is always on hand to 'pound' him; Susie, the little girl from down the road, often gets her own back on her snowball-throwing nemesis. Calvin's dad is a particularly funny creation: long-suffering, anti-media, and a proponent of fresh air, he also manages to get his revenge on his manic son by tying him up in mental knots with spurious bits of information . All these ingredients would, in the right hands, combine to make a perfectly good comic strip, but what always put Calvin and Hobbes ahead of the competition was the sheer artistry of Watterson's illustrations. In this regard, the chronological arrangement of the strips usefully shows Watterson's increasingly sophisticated technique, from his drawings of desert canyons and hideous inhabitants of alien planets, to the facial expressions of all his characters. It is hard to deny that Watterson owes a debt to Charles Schulz, whose Peanuts strip also offered a sophisticated yet deceptively simple evocation of the inner lives of children. For Calvin and Hobbes, however, Watterson combined uncanny ability, more than a touch of surrealism and a huge dose of humour to distil the essence of late-twentieth-century childhood, thereby elevating his strip into a league of its own.

This extraordinary graphic novel is so obviously a labour of love that the reader can only marvel at the energy that has been expended in its creation. Although the two plots that make up the book are essentially simple, the care with which Ware has executed them gives them an almost mythic quality. Jimmy Corrigan is a lonely, single, thirty-something with a boring job in an office cubicle, and a domineering mother who, in spite of living in a nursing home, is never far from the telephone or Jimmy. His crippling shyness renders him incapable of even saying hello to Peggy, the woman who works at an adjacent desk. When the father he has never known sends him an invitation and a plane ticket, Jimmy feels compelled to fly out to meet him. Jimmy's trip is mirrored by the boyhood tale of his grandfather, James, whose relationship with his father is tainted by unhappiness. Young James's mother has died, leaving his father with the unwanted job of bringing up the little boy alone, while at the same time maintaining his job as a glazier at the 1892 Chicago World's Fair. James is a frightened little boy, cowed by his father and bullied at school; he has a vagueness and fragility common to young, lonely and fearful children, qualities that are inherited generations later by his grandson. Chris Ware's illustrations are simply awe-inspiring in the true sense of the word. It is hard to believe that someone could put so much detail into each of the 380 pages that make up this incredible book, but there is a clue to his devotion in the afterword. After spending most of his life avoiding his own father, speaking only rarely on the phone, Ware finally met up with him: 'Gradually, the sublime outrageousness of our evening eroded into two people simply running out of things to say to each other. We weren't father and son anymore, just a pair of regretful men.'

Kelly Barnhill won the Newbery Medal in the US for this thoughtful and magical book about belonging, fear and family, and itâs easy to see why.

Jennifer Niven's deeply compelling and highly successful first teen novel All The Bright Places was very much for an older audience with its themes of depression and suicide. Her new book Holding Up the Universe is suitable for younger teens as well - and just as powerfully written. The book is narrated in turns by Libby, famous for once being 'America's Fattest Teen' and starting high school after years of being home schooled, and Jack, who seems to be one of the popular kids but secretly suffers from Prospagnosia - the inability to recognise the faces of familiar people even those in this own family which is often called 'face blindness'. Their worlds collide in a horribly cruel high school game and an unlikely friendship is formed that leads to something even deeper. Jennifer Niven is a gorgeous writer. Her characters Libby and Jack feel so real that it's almost impossible to believe they don't live and breathe. The author herself struggled with weight issues and anxiety over the years, particularly as a teenager, so this writing comes from the heart. The spotlight on prosopagnosia sheds an interesting light on a little known but not so uncommon condition. The ultimate message is uplifting and positive and one that teenagers everywhere need to hear: be yourself and you deserve to be wanted and loved for who you are.Â

The comic-strip adventures of Calvin, a naughty boy with a philosophical bent, and his soft toy tiger companion Hobbes, delighted readers from 1985 to 1995. The huge achievement of the comic's creator Bill Watterson is celebrated here in this wonderful cloth-bound three-volume box set, which contains in chronological order every Calvin and Hobbes strip. For those who have never experienced the sheer delight of Watterson's creation, here is a brief summary: Calvin is an active and imaginative little boy; his friend Hobbes appears as a stuffed tiger when other people are around, but when the two of them are alone he comes to life and is Calvin's friend and playmate. They live with Calvin's long-suffering parents, who have to cope with his turbulent behaviour. The charm of the strip is multi-faceted. On the one hand, Calvin is a typical six-year-old with a vivid imagination: one minute he is fearless intergalactic traveller Spaceman Spiff, crash-landing on a hostile planet, the next he is a fearsome T-Rex stalking his victim through the Jurassic jungle. He is in thrall to consumerism, hates school, loves making gruesome snowmen, and plays Calvinball, an anarchic game of ever-changing rules. Yet he is also given to philosophising about the big issues of life, ably supported or gently undermined by Hobbes's quietly caustic asides . Here is an outlet for Watterson's deeply-held views about the craziness of the modern world; indeed, the artist himself has always shunned publicity. The strip is also enhanced by its strong cast of supporting characters. Mrs Wormwood the teacher looms over Calvin when he not paying attention; the school bully is always on hand to 'pound' him; Susie, the little girl from down the road, often gets her own back on her snowball-throwing nemesis. Calvin's dad is a particularly funny creation: long-suffering, anti-media, and a proponent of fresh air, he also manages to get his revenge on his manic son by tying him up in mental knots with spurious bits of information . All these ingredients would, in the right hands, combine to make a perfectly good comic strip, but what always put Calvin and Hobbes ahead of the competition was the sheer artistry of Watterson's illustrations. In this regard, the chronological arrangement of the strips usefully shows Watterson's increasingly sophisticated technique, from his drawings of desert canyons and hideous inhabitants of alien planets, to the facial expressions of all his characters. It is hard to deny that Watterson owes a debt to Charles Schulz, whose Peanuts strip also offered a sophisticated yet deceptively simple evocation of the inner lives of children. For Calvin and Hobbes, however, Watterson combined uncanny ability, more than a touch of surrealism and a huge dose of humour to distil the essence of late-twentieth-century childhood, thereby elevating his strip into a league of its own.

On the eve of battle, Sir Thomas Lemuel Hawke of Cornwall writes a letter to his children. It is a guide on how to live well, like a knight: staying wise, humble, courageous, loving and kind. Hawke has tried to make this book look as authentic as possible. The cover stands out with a gold-embossed leaf. Inside, an editorâs note talks about the discovery of the âhistoricalâ letter, confirming Sir Thomas's death at the Battle of Slaughter Bridge in 1483.It all gives the book an important and timeless feel.

This extraordinary graphic novel is so obviously a labour of love that the reader can only marvel at the energy that has been expended in its creation. Although the two plots that make up the book are essentially simple, the care with which Ware has executed them gives them an almost mythic quality. Jimmy Corrigan is a lonely, single, thirty-something with a boring job in an office cubicle, and a domineering mother who, in spite of living in a nursing home, is never far from the telephone or Jimmy. His crippling shyness renders him incapable of even saying hello to Peggy, the woman who works at an adjacent desk. When the father he has never known sends him an invitation and a plane ticket, Jimmy feels compelled to fly out to meet him. Jimmy's trip is mirrored by the boyhood tale of his grandfather, James, whose relationship with his father is tainted by unhappiness. Young James's mother has died, leaving his father with the unwanted job of bringing up the little boy alone, while at the same time maintaining his job as a glazier at the 1892 Chicago World's Fair. James is a frightened little boy, cowed by his father and bullied at school; he has a vagueness and fragility common to young, lonely and fearful children, qualities that are inherited generations later by his grandson. Chris Ware's illustrations are simply awe-inspiring in the true sense of the word. It is hard to believe that someone could put so much detail into each of the 380 pages that make up this incredible book, but there is a clue to his devotion in the afterword. After spending most of his life avoiding his own father, speaking only rarely on the phone, Ware finally met up with him: 'Gradually, the sublime outrageousness of our evening eroded into two people simply running out of things to say to each other. We weren't father and son anymore, just a pair of regretful men.'

Kelly Barnhill won the Newbery Medal in the US for this thoughtful and magical book about belonging, fear and family, and itâs easy to see why.

Jennifer Niven's deeply compelling and highly successful first teen novel All The Bright Places was very much for an older audience with its themes of depression and suicide. Her new book Holding Up the Universe is suitable for younger teens as well - and just as powerfully written. The book is narrated in turns by Libby, famous for once being 'America's Fattest Teen' and starting high school after years of being home schooled, and Jack, who seems to be one of the popular kids but secretly suffers from Prospagnosia - the inability to recognise the faces of familiar people even those in this own family which is often called 'face blindness'. Their worlds collide in a horribly cruel high school game and an unlikely friendship is formed that leads to something even deeper. Jennifer Niven is a gorgeous writer. Her characters Libby and Jack feel so real that it's almost impossible to believe they don't live and breathe. The author herself struggled with weight issues and anxiety over the years, particularly as a teenager, so this writing comes from the heart. The spotlight on prosopagnosia sheds an interesting light on a little known but not so uncommon condition. The ultimate message is uplifting and positive and one that teenagers everywhere need to hear: be yourself and you deserve to be wanted and loved for who you are.Â

The comic-strip adventures of Calvin, a naughty boy with a philosophical bent, and his soft toy tiger companion Hobbes, delighted readers from 1985 to 1995. The huge achievement of the comic's creator Bill Watterson is celebrated here in this wonderful cloth-bound three-volume box set, which contains in chronological order every Calvin and Hobbes strip. For those who have never experienced the sheer delight of Watterson's creation, here is a brief summary: Calvin is an active and imaginative little boy; his friend Hobbes appears as a stuffed tiger when other people are around, but when the two of them are alone he comes to life and is Calvin's friend and playmate. They live with Calvin's long-suffering parents, who have to cope with his turbulent behaviour. The charm of the strip is multi-faceted. On the one hand, Calvin is a typical six-year-old with a vivid imagination: one minute he is fearless intergalactic traveller Spaceman Spiff, crash-landing on a hostile planet, the next he is a fearsome T-Rex stalking his victim through the Jurassic jungle. He is in thrall to consumerism, hates school, loves making gruesome snowmen, and plays Calvinball, an anarchic game of ever-changing rules. Yet he is also given to philosophising about the big issues of life, ably supported or gently undermined by Hobbes's quietly caustic asides . Here is an outlet for Watterson's deeply-held views about the craziness of the modern world; indeed, the artist himself has always shunned publicity. The strip is also enhanced by its strong cast of supporting characters. Mrs Wormwood the teacher looms over Calvin when he not paying attention; the school bully is always on hand to 'pound' him; Susie, the little girl from down the road, often gets her own back on her snowball-throwing nemesis. Calvin's dad is a particularly funny creation: long-suffering, anti-media, and a proponent of fresh air, he also manages to get his revenge on his manic son by tying him up in mental knots with spurious bits of information . All these ingredients would, in the right hands, combine to make a perfectly good comic strip, but what always put Calvin and Hobbes ahead of the competition was the sheer artistry of Watterson's illustrations. In this regard, the chronological arrangement of the strips usefully shows Watterson's increasingly sophisticated technique, from his drawings of desert canyons and hideous inhabitants of alien planets, to the facial expressions of all his characters. It is hard to deny that Watterson owes a debt to Charles Schulz, whose Peanuts strip also offered a sophisticated yet deceptively simple evocation of the inner lives of children. For Calvin and Hobbes, however, Watterson combined uncanny ability, more than a touch of surrealism and a huge dose of humour to distil the essence of late-twentieth-century childhood, thereby elevating his strip into a league of its own.

On the eve of battle, Sir Thomas Lemuel Hawke of Cornwall writes a letter to his children. It is a guide on how to live well, like a knight: staying wise, humble, courageous, loving and kind.

Inside, an editorâs note talks about the discovery of the âhistoricalâ letter, confirming Sir Thomas's death at the Battle of Slaughter Bridge in 1483.It all gives the book an important and timeless feel.

This extraordinary graphic novel is so obviously a labour of love that the reader can only marvel at the energy that has been expended in its creation. Although the two plots that make up the book are essentially simple, the care with which Ware has executed them gives them an almost mythic quality. Jimmy Corrigan is a lonely, single, thirty-something with a boring job in an office cubicle, and a domineering mother who, in spite of living in a nursing home, is never far from the telephone or Jimmy. His crippling shyness renders him incapable of even saying hello to Peggy, the woman who works at an adjacent desk. When the father he has never known sends him an invitation and a plane ticket, Jimmy feels compelled to fly out to meet him. Jimmy's trip is mirrored by the boyhood tale of his grandfather, James, whose relationship with his father is tainted by unhappiness. Young James's mother has died, leaving his father with the unwanted job of bringing up the little boy alone, while at the same time maintaining his job as a glazier at the 1892 Chicago World's Fair. James is a frightened little boy, cowed by his father and bullied at school; he has a vagueness and fragility common to young, lonely and fearful children, qualities that are inherited generations later by his grandson. Chris Ware's illustrations are simply awe-inspiring in the true sense of the word. It is hard to believe that someone could put so much detail into each of the 380 pages that make up this incredible book, but there is a clue to his devotion in the afterword. After spending most of his life avoiding his own father, speaking only rarely on the phone, Ware finally met up with him: 'Gradually, the sublime outrageousness of our evening eroded into two people simply running out of things to say to each other. We weren't father and son anymore, just a pair of regretful men.'

Every year, the evil Protectorate offers a baby to the evil witch in the forest to ensure their villageâs safety. Yet, unknown to them, the witch is Xan, the plump and knowledgeable protector of the babies that she takes to the neighbouring village to be raised as special children, fed on starlight and destined to do wonderful things.

But nothing is straightforward, and when Luna turns 13, everything will change. Kelly Barnhill won the Newbery Medal in the US for this thoughtful and magical book about belonging, fear and family, and itâs easy to see why. The writing flows beautifully and Barnhillâs keen observation of human nature fits naturally into the story, which moves along at a satisfying pace. Xan is a delightfully pleasant and caring crone witch who dispels the traditional image of cackling evildoer, and replaces it with something far more loving and magical.

Jennifer Niven's deeply compelling and highly successful first teen novel All The Bright Places was very much for an older audience with its themes of depression and suicide. Her new book Holding Up the Universe is suitable for younger teens as well - and just as powerfully written. The book is narrated in turns by Libby, famous for once being 'America's Fattest Teen' and starting high school after years of being home schooled, and Jack, who seems to be one of the popular kids but secretly suffers from Prospagnosia - the inability to recognise the faces of familiar people even those in this own family which is often called 'face blindness'. Their worlds collide in a horribly cruel high school game and an unlikely friendship is formed that leads to something even deeper. Jennifer Niven is a gorgeous writer. Her characters Libby and Jack feel so real that it's almost impossible to believe they don't live and breathe. The author herself struggled with weight issues and anxiety over the years, particularly as a teenager, so this writing comes from the heart. The spotlight on prosopagnosia sheds an interesting light on a little known but not so uncommon condition. The ultimate message is uplifting and positive and one that teenagers everywhere need to hear: be yourself and you deserve to be wanted and loved for who you are.Â

The comic-strip adventures of Calvin, a naughty boy with a philosophical bent, and his soft toy tiger companion Hobbes, delighted readers from 1985 to 1995. The huge achievement of the comic's creator Bill Watterson is celebrated here in this wonderful cloth-bound three-volume box set, which contains in chronological order every Calvin and Hobbes strip. For those who have never experienced the sheer delight of Watterson's creation, here is a brief summary: Calvin is an active and imaginative little boy; his friend Hobbes appears as a stuffed tiger when other people are around, but when the two of them are alone he comes to life and is Calvin's friend and playmate. They live with Calvin's long-suffering parents, who have to cope with his turbulent behaviour. The charm of the strip is multi-faceted. On the one hand, Calvin is a typical six-year-old with a vivid imagination: one minute he is fearless intergalactic traveller Spaceman Spiff, crash-landing on a hostile planet, the next he is a fearsome T-Rex stalking his victim through the Jurassic jungle. He is in thrall to consumerism, hates school, loves making gruesome snowmen, and plays Calvinball, an anarchic game of ever-changing rules. Yet he is also given to philosophising about the big issues of life, ably supported or gently undermined by Hobbes's quietly caustic asides . Here is an outlet for Watterson's deeply-held views about the craziness of the modern world; indeed, the artist himself has always shunned publicity. The strip is also enhanced by its strong cast of supporting characters. Mrs Wormwood the teacher looms over Calvin when he not paying attention; the school bully is always on hand to 'pound' him; Susie, the little girl from down the road, often gets her own back on her snowball-throwing nemesis. Calvin's dad is a particularly funny creation: long-suffering, anti-media, and a proponent of fresh air, he also manages to get his revenge on his manic son by tying him up in mental knots with spurious bits of information . All these ingredients would, in the right hands, combine to make a perfectly good comic strip, but what always put Calvin and Hobbes ahead of the competition was the sheer artistry of Watterson's illustrations. In this regard, the chronological arrangement of the strips usefully shows Watterson's increasingly sophisticated technique, from his drawings of desert canyons and hideous inhabitants of alien planets, to the facial expressions of all his characters. It is hard to deny that Watterson owes a debt to Charles Schulz, whose Peanuts strip also offered a sophisticated yet deceptively simple evocation of the inner lives of children. For Calvin and Hobbes, however, Watterson combined uncanny ability, more than a touch of surrealism and a huge dose of humour to distil the essence of late-twentieth-century childhood, thereby elevating his strip into a league of its own.

On the eve of battle, Sir Thomas Lemuel Hawke of Cornwall writes a letter to his children. It is a guide on how to live well, like a knight: staying wise, humble, courageous, loving and kind. Hawke has tried to make this book look as authentic as possible. The cover stands out with a gold-embossed leaf. Inside, an editorâs note talks about the discovery of the âhistoricalâ letter, confirming Sir Thomas's death at the Battle of Slaughter Bridge in 1483.It all gives the book an important and timeless feel.

Her characters are spunky, smart-mouthed, tormented, emotionally yearning and contemporary. Itâs Firefly meets Assassinâs Creed, but Graudin has a way with words that gives the book depth and makes it more than just an enjoyable page-turner.

This extraordinary graphic novel is so obviously a labour of love that the reader can only marvel at the energy that has been expended in its creation. Although the two plots that make up the book are essentially simple, the care with which Ware has executed them gives them an almost mythic quality. Jimmy Corrigan is a lonely, single, thirty-something with a boring job in an office cubicle, and a domineering mother who, in spite of living in a nursing home, is never far from the telephone or Jimmy. His crippling shyness renders him incapable of even saying hello to Peggy, the woman who works at an adjacent desk. When the father he has never known sends him an invitation and a plane ticket, Jimmy feels compelled to fly out to meet him. Jimmy's trip is mirrored by the boyhood tale of his grandfather, James, whose relationship with his father is tainted by unhappiness. Young James's mother has died, leaving his father with the unwanted job of bringing up the little boy alone, while at the same time maintaining his job as a glazier at the 1892 Chicago World's Fair. James is a frightened little boy, cowed by his father and bullied at school; he has a vagueness and fragility common to young, lonely and fearful children, qualities that are inherited generations later by his grandson. Chris Ware's illustrations are simply awe-inspiring in the true sense of the word. It is hard to believe that someone could put so much detail into each of the 380 pages that make up this incredible book, but there is a clue to his devotion in the afterword. After spending most of his life avoiding his own father, speaking only rarely on the phone, Ware finally met up with him: 'Gradually, the sublime outrageousness of our evening eroded into two people simply running out of things to say to each other. We weren't father and son anymore, just a pair of regretful men.'

Every year, the evil Protectorate offers a baby to the evil witch in the forest to ensure their villageâs safety. Yet, unknown to them, the witch is Xan, the plump and knowledgeable protector of the babies that she takes to the neighbouring village to be raised as special children, fed on starlight and destined to do wonderful things.

Kelly Barnhill won the Newbery Medal in the US for this thoughtful and magical book about belonging, fear and family, and itâs easy to see why.

Jennifer Niven's deeply compelling and highly successful first teen novel All The Bright Places was very much for an older audience with its themes of depression and suicide. Her new book Holding Up the Universe is suitable for younger teens as well - and just as powerfully written. The book is narrated in turns by Libby, famous for once being 'America's Fattest Teen' and starting high school after years of being home schooled, and Jack, who seems to be one of the popular kids but secretly suffers from Prospagnosia - the inability to recognise the faces of familiar people even those in this own family which is often called 'face blindness'. Their worlds collide in a horribly cruel high school game and an unlikely friendship is formed that leads to something even deeper. Jennifer Niven is a gorgeous writer. Her characters Libby and Jack feel so real that it's almost impossible to believe they don't live and breathe. The author herself struggled with weight issues and anxiety over the years, particularly as a teenager, so this writing comes from the heart. The spotlight on prosopagnosia sheds an interesting light on a little known but not so uncommon condition. The ultimate message is uplifting and positive and one that teenagers everywhere need to hear: be yourself and you deserve to be wanted and loved for who you are.Â

The comic-strip adventures of Calvin, a naughty boy with a philosophical bent, and his soft toy tiger companion Hobbes, delighted readers from 1985 to 1995. The huge achievement of the comic's creator Bill Watterson is celebrated here in this wonderful cloth-bound three-volume box set, which contains in chronological order every Calvin and Hobbes strip. For those who have never experienced the sheer delight of Watterson's creation, here is a brief summary: Calvin is an active and imaginative little boy; his friend Hobbes appears as a stuffed tiger when other people are around, but when the two of them are alone he comes to life and is Calvin's friend and playmate. They live with Calvin's long-suffering parents, who have to cope with his turbulent behaviour. The charm of the strip is multi-faceted. On the one hand, Calvin is a typical six-year-old with a vivid imagination: one minute he is fearless intergalactic traveller Spaceman Spiff, crash-landing on a hostile planet, the next he is a fearsome T-Rex stalking his victim through the Jurassic jungle. He is in thrall to consumerism, hates school, loves making gruesome snowmen, and plays Calvinball, an anarchic game of ever-changing rules. Yet he is also given to philosophising about the big issues of life, ably supported or gently undermined by Hobbes's quietly caustic asides . Here is an outlet for Watterson's deeply-held views about the craziness of the modern world; indeed, the artist himself has always shunned publicity. The strip is also enhanced by its strong cast of supporting characters. Mrs Wormwood the teacher looms over Calvin when he not paying attention; the school bully is always on hand to 'pound' him; Susie, the little girl from down the road, often gets her own back on her snowball-throwing nemesis. Calvin's dad is a particularly funny creation: long-suffering, anti-media, and a proponent of fresh air, he also manages to get his revenge on his manic son by tying him up in mental knots with spurious bits of information . All these ingredients would, in the right hands, combine to make a perfectly good comic strip, but what always put Calvin and Hobbes ahead of the competition was the sheer artistry of Watterson's illustrations. In this regard, the chronological arrangement of the strips usefully shows Watterson's increasingly sophisticated technique, from his drawings of desert canyons and hideous inhabitants of alien planets, to the facial expressions of all his characters. It is hard to deny that Watterson owes a debt to Charles Schulz, whose Peanuts strip also offered a sophisticated yet deceptively simple evocation of the inner lives of children. For Calvin and Hobbes, however, Watterson combined uncanny ability, more than a touch of surrealism and a huge dose of humour to distil the essence of late-twentieth-century childhood, thereby elevating his strip into a league of its own.

On the eve of battle, Sir Thomas Lemuel Hawke of Cornwall writes a letter to his children. It is a guide on how to live well, like a knight: staying wise, humble, courageous, loving and kind. Hawke has tried to make this book look as authentic as possible. The cover stands out with a gold-embossed leaf. Inside, an editorâs note talks about the discovery of the âhistoricalâ letter, confirming Sir Thomas's death at the Battle of Slaughter Bridge in 1483.It all gives the book an important and timeless feel.

This extraordinary graphic novel is so obviously a labour of love that the reader can only marvel at the energy that has been expended in its creation. Although the two plots that make up the book are essentially simple, the care with which Ware has executed them gives them an almost mythic quality. Jimmy Corrigan is a lonely, single, thirty-something with a boring job in an office cubicle, and a domineering mother who, in spite of living in a nursing home, is never far from the telephone or Jimmy. His crippling shyness renders him incapable of even saying hello to Peggy, the woman who works at an adjacent desk. When the father he has never known sends him an invitation and a plane ticket, Jimmy feels compelled to fly out to meet him. Jimmy's trip is mirrored by the boyhood tale of his grandfather, James, whose relationship with his father is tainted by unhappiness. Young James's mother has died, leaving his father with the unwanted job of bringing up the little boy alone, while at the same time maintaining his job as a glazier at the 1892 Chicago World's Fair. James is a frightened little boy, cowed by his father and bullied at school; he has a vagueness and fragility common to young, lonely and fearful children, qualities that are inherited generations later by his grandson. Chris Ware's illustrations are simply awe-inspiring in the true sense of the word. It is hard to believe that someone could put so much detail into each of the 380 pages that make up this incredible book, but there is a clue to his devotion in the afterword. After spending most of his life avoiding his own father, speaking only rarely on the phone, Ware finally met up with him: 'Gradually, the sublime outrageousness of our evening eroded into two people simply running out of things to say to each other. We weren't father and son anymore, just a pair of regretful men.'

Every year, the evil Protectorate offers a baby to the evil witch in the forest to ensure their villageâs safety. Yet, unknown to them, the witch is Xan, the plump and knowledgeable protector of the babies that she takes to the neighbouring village to be raised as special children, fed on starlight and destined to do wonderful things.

Jennifer Niven's deeply compelling and highly successful first teen novel All The Bright Places was very much for an older audience with its themes of depression and suicide. Her new book Holding Up the Universe is suitable for younger teens as well - and just as powerfully written. The book is narrated in turns by Libby, famous for once being 'America's Fattest Teen' and starting high school after years of being home schooled, and Jack, who seems to be one of the popular kids but secretly suffers from Prospagnosia - the inability to recognise the faces of familiar people even those in this own family which is often called 'face blindness'. Their worlds collide in a horribly cruel high school game and an unlikely friendship is formed that leads to something even deeper. Jennifer Niven is a gorgeous writer. Her characters Libby and Jack feel so real that it's almost impossible to believe they don't live and breathe. The author herself struggled with weight issues and anxiety over the years, particularly as a teenager, so this writing comes from the heart. The spotlight on prosopagnosia sheds an interesting light on a little known but not so uncommon condition. The ultimate message is uplifting and positive and one that teenagers everywhere need to hear: be yourself and you deserve to be wanted and loved for who you are.Â

The comic-strip adventures of Calvin, a naughty boy with a philosophical bent, and his soft toy tiger companion Hobbes, delighted readers from 1985 to 1995. The huge achievement of the comic's creator Bill Watterson is celebrated here in this wonderful cloth-bound three-volume box set, which contains in chronological order every Calvin and Hobbes strip. For those who have never experienced the sheer delight of Watterson's creation, here is a brief summary: Calvin is an active and imaginative little boy; his friend Hobbes appears as a stuffed tiger when other people are around, but when the two of them are alone he comes to life and is Calvin's friend and playmate. They live with Calvin's long-suffering parents, who have to cope with his turbulent behaviour. The charm of the strip is multi-faceted. On the one hand, Calvin is a typical six-year-old with a vivid imagination: one minute he is fearless intergalactic traveller Spaceman Spiff, crash-landing on a hostile planet, the next he is a fearsome T-Rex stalking his victim through the Jurassic jungle. He is in thrall to consumerism, hates school, loves making gruesome snowmen, and plays Calvinball, an anarchic game of ever-changing rules. Yet he is also given to philosophising about the big issues of life, ably supported or gently undermined by Hobbes's quietly caustic asides . Here is an outlet for Watterson's deeply-held views about the craziness of the modern world; indeed, the artist himself has always shunned publicity. The strip is also enhanced by its strong cast of supporting characters. Mrs Wormwood the teacher looms over Calvin when he not paying attention; the school bully is always on hand to 'pound' him; Susie, the little girl from down the road, often gets her own back on her snowball-throwing nemesis. Calvin's dad is a particularly funny creation: long-suffering, anti-media, and a proponent of fresh air, he also manages to get his revenge on his manic son by tying him up in mental knots with spurious bits of information . All these ingredients would, in the right hands, combine to make a perfectly good comic strip, but what always put Calvin and Hobbes ahead of the competition was the sheer artistry of Watterson's illustrations. In this regard, the chronological arrangement of the strips usefully shows Watterson's increasingly sophisticated technique, from his drawings of desert canyons and hideous inhabitants of alien planets, to the facial expressions of all his characters. It is hard to deny that Watterson owes a debt to Charles Schulz, whose Peanuts strip also offered a sophisticated yet deceptively simple evocation of the inner lives of children. For Calvin and Hobbes, however, Watterson combined uncanny ability, more than a touch of surrealism and a huge dose of humour to distil the essence of late-twentieth-century childhood, thereby elevating his strip into a league of its own.

On the eve of battle, Sir Thomas Lemuel Hawke of Cornwall writes a letter to his children. It is a guide on how to live well, like a knight: staying wise, humble, courageous, loving and kind. Hawke has tried to make this book look as authentic as possible. The cover stands out with a gold-embossed leaf. Inside, an editorâs note talks about the discovery of the âhistoricalâ letter, confirming Sir Thomas's death at the Battle of Slaughter Bridge in 1483.It all gives the book an important and timeless feel.

This extraordinary graphic novel is so obviously a labour of love that the reader can only marvel at the energy that has been expended in its creation. Although the two plots that make up the book are essentially simple, the care with which Ware has executed them gives them an almost mythic quality. Jimmy Corrigan is a lonely, single, thirty-something with a boring job in an office cubicle, and a domineering mother who, in spite of living in a nursing home, is never far from the telephone or Jimmy. His crippling shyness renders him incapable of even saying hello to Peggy, the woman who works at an adjacent desk. When the father he has never known sends him an invitation and a plane ticket, Jimmy feels compelled to fly out to meet him. Jimmy's trip is mirrored by the boyhood tale of his grandfather, James, whose relationship with his father is tainted by unhappiness. Young James's mother has died, leaving his father with the unwanted job of bringing up the little boy alone, while at the same time maintaining his job as a glazier at the 1892 Chicago World's Fair. James is a frightened little boy, cowed by his father and bullied at school; he has a vagueness and fragility common to young, lonely and fearful children, qualities that are inherited generations later by his grandson. Chris Ware's illustrations are simply awe-inspiring in the true sense of the word. It is hard to believe that someone could put so much detail into each of the 380 pages that make up this incredible book, but there is a clue to his devotion in the afterword. After spending most of his life avoiding his own father, speaking only rarely on the phone, Ware finally met up with him: 'Gradually, the sublime outrageousness of our evening eroded into two people simply running out of things to say to each other. We weren't father and son anymore, just a pair of regretful men.'

Every year, the evil Protectorate offers a baby to the evil witch in the forest to ensure their villageâs safety. Yet, unknown to them, the witch is Xan, the plump and knowledgeable protector of the babies that she takes to the neighbouring village to be raised as special children, fed on starlight and destined to do wonderful things.

But nothing is straightforward, and when Luna turns 13, everything will change. Kelly Barnhill won the Newbery Medal in the US for this thoughtful and magical book about belonging, fear and family, and itâs easy to see why.

Jennifer Niven's deeply compelling and highly successful first teen novel All The Bright Places was very much for an older audience with its themes of depression and suicide. Her new book Holding Up the Universe is suitable for younger teens as well - and just as powerfully written. The book is narrated in turns by Libby, famous for once being 'America's Fattest Teen' and starting high school after years of being home schooled, and Jack, who seems to be one of the popular kids but secretly suffers from Prospagnosia - the inability to recognise the faces of familiar people even those in this own family which is often called 'face blindness'. Their worlds collide in a horribly cruel high school game and an unlikely friendship is formed that leads to something even deeper. Jennifer Niven is a gorgeous writer. Her characters Libby and Jack feel so real that it's almost impossible to believe they don't live and breathe. The author herself struggled with weight issues and anxiety over the years, particularly as a teenager, so this writing comes from the heart. The spotlight on prosopagnosia sheds an interesting light on a little known but not so uncommon condition. The ultimate message is uplifting and positive and one that teenagers everywhere need to hear: be yourself and you deserve to be wanted and loved for who you are.Â

The comic-strip adventures of Calvin, a naughty boy with a philosophical bent, and his soft toy tiger companion Hobbes, delighted readers from 1985 to 1995. The huge achievement of the comic's creator Bill Watterson is celebrated here in this wonderful cloth-bound three-volume box set, which contains in chronological order every Calvin and Hobbes strip. For those who have never experienced the sheer delight of Watterson's creation, here is a brief summary: Calvin is an active and imaginative little boy; his friend Hobbes appears as a stuffed tiger when other people are around, but when the two of them are alone he comes to life and is Calvin's friend and playmate. They live with Calvin's long-suffering parents, who have to cope with his turbulent behaviour. The charm of the strip is multi-faceted. On the one hand, Calvin is a typical six-year-old with a vivid imagination: one minute he is fearless intergalactic traveller Spaceman Spiff, crash-landing on a hostile planet, the next he is a fearsome T-Rex stalking his victim through the Jurassic jungle. He is in thrall to consumerism, hates school, loves making gruesome snowmen, and plays Calvinball, an anarchic game of ever-changing rules. Yet he is also given to philosophising about the big issues of life, ably supported or gently undermined by Hobbes's quietly caustic asides . Here is an outlet for Watterson's deeply-held views about the craziness of the modern world; indeed, the artist himself has always shunned publicity. The strip is also enhanced by its strong cast of supporting characters. Mrs Wormwood the teacher looms over Calvin when he not paying attention; the school bully is always on hand to 'pound' him; Susie, the little girl from down the road, often gets her own back on her snowball-throwing nemesis. Calvin's dad is a particularly funny creation: long-suffering, anti-media, and a proponent of fresh air, he also manages to get his revenge on his manic son by tying him up in mental knots with spurious bits of information . All these ingredients would, in the right hands, combine to make a perfectly good comic strip, but what always put Calvin and Hobbes ahead of the competition was the sheer artistry of Watterson's illustrations. In this regard, the chronological arrangement of the strips usefully shows Watterson's increasingly sophisticated technique, from his drawings of desert canyons and hideous inhabitants of alien planets, to the facial expressions of all his characters. It is hard to deny that Watterson owes a debt to Charles Schulz, whose Peanuts strip also offered a sophisticated yet deceptively simple evocation of the inner lives of children. For Calvin and Hobbes, however, Watterson combined uncanny ability, more than a touch of surrealism and a huge dose of humour to distil the essence of late-twentieth-century childhood, thereby elevating his strip into a league of its own.

Although the two plots that make up the book are essentially simple, the care with which Ware has executed them gives them an almost mythic quality. Jimmy Corrigan is a lonely, single, thirty-something with a boring job in an office cubicle, and a domineering mother who, in spite of living in a nursing home, is never far from the telephone or Jimmy. His crippling shyness renders him incapable of even saying hello to Peggy, the woman who works at an adjacent desk. When the father he has never known sends him an invitation and a plane ticket, Jimmy feels compelled to fly out to meet him. Jimmy's trip is mirrored by the boyhood tale of his grandfather, James, whose relationship with his father is tainted by unhappiness. Young James's mother has died, leaving his father with the unwanted job of bringing up the little boy alone, while at the same time maintaining his job as a glazier at the 1892 Chicago World's Fair. James is a frightened little boy, cowed by his father and bullied at school; he has a vagueness and fragility common to young, lonely and fearful children, qualities that are inherited generations later by his grandson. Chris Ware's illustrations are simply awe-inspiring in the true sense of the word. It is hard to believe that someone could put so much detail into each of the 380 pages that make up this incredible book, but there is a clue to his devotion in the afterword. After spending most of his life avoiding his own father, speaking only rarely on the phone, Ware finally met up with him: 'Gradually, the sublime outrageousness of our evening eroded into two people simply running out of things to say to each other. We weren't father and son anymore, just a pair of regretful men.'

Every year, the evil Protectorate offers a baby to the evil witch in the forest to ensure their villageâs safety. Yet, unknown to them, the witch is Xan, the plump and knowledgeable protector of the babies that she takes to the neighbouring village to be raised as special children, fed on starlight and destined to do wonderful things. Yet, one day, Xan feeds one baby the moon by mistake and fills her with a huge amount of magicÂ â a dangerous amount, as it turns outÂ â so Xan decides to raise Luna as her own. But nothing is straightforward, and when Luna turns 13, everything will change. Kelly Barnhill won the Newbery Medal in the US for this thoughtful and magical book about belonging, fear and family, and itâs easy to see why. The writing flows beautifully and Barnhillâs keen observation of human nature fits naturally into the story, which moves along at a satisfying pace. Xan is a delightfully pleasant and caring crone witch who dispels the traditional image of cackling evildoer, and replaces it with something far more loving and magical.

Jennifer Niven's deeply compelling and highly successful first teen novel All The Bright Places was very much for an older audience with its themes of depression and suicide. Her new book Holding Up the Universe is suitable for younger teens as well - and just as powerfully written. The book is narrated in turns by Libby, famous for once being 'America's Fattest Teen' and starting high school after years of being home schooled, and Jack, who seems to be one of the popular kids but secretly suffers from Prospagnosia - the inability to recognise the faces of familiar people even those in this own family which is often called 'face blindness'. Their worlds collide in a horribly cruel high school game and an unlikely friendship is formed that leads to something even deeper. Jennifer Niven is a gorgeous writer. Her characters Libby and Jack feel so real that it's almost impossible to believe they don't live and breathe. The author herself struggled with weight issues and anxiety over the years, particularly as a teenager, so this writing comes from the heart. The spotlight on prosopagnosia sheds an interesting light on a little known but not so uncommon condition. The ultimate message is uplifting and positive and one that teenagers everywhere need to hear: be yourself and you deserve to be wanted and loved for who you are.Â

The comic-strip adventures of Calvin, a naughty boy with a philosophical bent, and his soft toy tiger companion Hobbes, delighted readers from 1985 to 1995. The huge achievement of the comic's creator Bill Watterson is celebrated here in this wonderful cloth-bound three-volume box set, which contains in chronological order every Calvin and Hobbes strip. For those who have never experienced the sheer delight of Watterson's creation, here is a brief summary: Calvin is an active and imaginative little boy; his friend Hobbes appears as a stuffed tiger when other people are around, but when the two of them are alone he comes to life and is Calvin's friend and playmate. They live with Calvin's long-suffering parents, who have to cope with his turbulent behaviour. The charm of the strip is multi-faceted. On the one hand, Calvin is a typical six-year-old with a vivid imagination: one minute he is fearless intergalactic traveller Spaceman Spiff, crash-landing on a hostile planet, the next he is a fearsome T-Rex stalking his victim through the Jurassic jungle. He is in thrall to consumerism, hates school, loves making gruesome snowmen, and plays Calvinball, an anarchic game of ever-changing rules. Yet he is also given to philosophising about the big issues of life, ably supported or gently undermined by Hobbes's quietly caustic asides . Here is an outlet for Watterson's deeply-held views about the craziness of the modern world; indeed, the artist himself has always shunned publicity. The strip is also enhanced by its strong cast of supporting characters. Mrs Wormwood the teacher looms over Calvin when he not paying attention; the school bully is always on hand to 'pound' him; Susie, the little girl from down the road, often gets her own back on her snowball-throwing nemesis. Calvin's dad is a particularly funny creation: long-suffering, anti-media, and a proponent of fresh air, he also manages to get his revenge on his manic son by tying him up in mental knots with spurious bits of information . All these ingredients would, in the right hands, combine to make a perfectly good comic strip, but what always put Calvin and Hobbes ahead of the competition was the sheer artistry of Watterson's illustrations. In this regard, the chronological arrangement of the strips usefully shows Watterson's increasingly sophisticated technique, from his drawings of desert canyons and hideous inhabitants of alien planets, to the facial expressions of all his characters. It is hard to deny that Watterson owes a debt to Charles Schulz, whose Peanuts strip also offered a sophisticated yet deceptively simple evocation of the inner lives of children. For Calvin and Hobbes, however, Watterson combined uncanny ability, more than a touch of surrealism and a huge dose of humour to distil the essence of late-twentieth-century childhood, thereby elevating his strip into a league of its own.

On the eve of battle, Sir Thomas Lemuel Hawke of Cornwall writes a letter to his children. It is a guide on how to live well, like a knight: staying wise, humble, courageous, loving and kind.

This extraordinary graphic novel is so obviously a labour of love that the reader can only marvel at the energy that has been expended in its creation. Although the two plots that make up the book are essentially simple, the care with which Ware has executed them gives them an almost mythic quality. Jimmy Corrigan is a lonely, single, thirty-something with a boring job in an office cubicle, and a domineering mother who, in spite of living in a nursing home, is never far from the telephone or Jimmy. His crippling shyness renders him incapable of even saying hello to Peggy, the woman who works at an adjacent desk. When the father he has never known sends him an invitation and a plane ticket, Jimmy feels compelled to fly out to meet him. Jimmy's trip is mirrored by the boyhood tale of his grandfather, James, whose relationship with his father is tainted by unhappiness. Young James's mother has died, leaving his father with the unwanted job of bringing up the little boy alone, while at the same time maintaining his job as a glazier at the 1892 Chicago World's Fair. James is a frightened little boy, cowed by his father and bullied at school; he has a vagueness and fragility common to young, lonely and fearful children, qualities that are inherited generations later by his grandson. Chris Ware's illustrations are simply awe-inspiring in the true sense of the word. It is hard to believe that someone could put so much detail into each of the 380 pages that make up this incredible book, but there is a clue to his devotion in the afterword. After spending most of his life avoiding his own father, speaking only rarely on the phone, Ware finally met up with him: 'Gradually, the sublime outrageousness of our evening eroded into two people simply running out of things to say to each other. We weren't father and son anymore, just a pair of regretful men.'

Every year, the evil Protectorate offers a baby to the evil witch in the forest to ensure their villageâs safety. Yet, unknown to them, the witch is Xan, the plump and knowledgeable protector of the babies that she takes to the neighbouring village to be raised as special children, fed on starlight and destined to do wonderful things.

Xan is a delightfully pleasant and caring crone witch who dispels the traditional image of cackling evildoer, and replaces it with something far more loving and magical.

Oppel also examines Benâs teenage angst over his own personal relationships, and the ethics of animal experimentation in this absorbing novel.

Jennifer Niven's deeply compelling and highly successful first teen novel All The Bright Places was very much for an older audience with its themes of depression and suicide. Her new book Holding Up the Universe is suitable for younger teens as well - and just as powerfully written. The book is narrated in turns by Libby, famous for once being 'America's Fattest Teen' and starting high school after years of being home schooled, and Jack, who seems to be one of the popular kids but secretly suffers from Prospagnosia - the inability to recognise the faces of familiar people even those in this own family which is often called 'face blindness'. Their worlds collide in a horribly cruel high school game and an unlikely friendship is formed that leads to something even deeper. Jennifer Niven is a gorgeous writer. Her characters Libby and Jack feel so real that it's almost impossible to believe they don't live and breathe. The author herself struggled with weight issues and anxiety over the years, particularly as a teenager, so this writing comes from the heart. The spotlight on prosopagnosia sheds an interesting light on a little known but not so uncommon condition. The ultimate message is uplifting and positive and one that teenagers everywhere need to hear: be yourself and you deserve to be wanted and loved for who you are.Â

The comic-strip adventures of Calvin, a naughty boy with a philosophical bent, and his soft toy tiger companion Hobbes, delighted readers from 1985 to 1995. The huge achievement of the comic's creator Bill Watterson is celebrated here in this wonderful cloth-bound three-volume box set, which contains in chronological order every Calvin and Hobbes strip. For those who have never experienced the sheer delight of Watterson's creation, here is a brief summary: Calvin is an active and imaginative little boy; his friend Hobbes appears as a stuffed tiger when other people are around, but when the two of them are alone he comes to life and is Calvin's friend and playmate. They live with Calvin's long-suffering parents, who have to cope with his turbulent behaviour. The charm of the strip is multi-faceted. On the one hand, Calvin is a typical six-year-old with a vivid imagination: one minute he is fearless intergalactic traveller Spaceman Spiff, crash-landing on a hostile planet, the next he is a fearsome T-Rex stalking his victim through the Jurassic jungle. He is in thrall to consumerism, hates school, loves making gruesome snowmen, and plays Calvinball, an anarchic game of ever-changing rules. Yet he is also given to philosophising about the big issues of life, ably supported or gently undermined by Hobbes's quietly caustic asides . Here is an outlet for Watterson's deeply-held views about the craziness of the modern world; indeed, the artist himself has always shunned publicity. The strip is also enhanced by its strong cast of supporting characters. Mrs Wormwood the teacher looms over Calvin when he not paying attention; the school bully is always on hand to 'pound' him; Susie, the little girl from down the road, often gets her own back on her snowball-throwing nemesis. Calvin's dad is a particularly funny creation: long-suffering, anti-media, and a proponent of fresh air, he also manages to get his revenge on his manic son by tying him up in mental knots with spurious bits of information . All these ingredients would, in the right hands, combine to make a perfectly good comic strip, but what always put Calvin and Hobbes ahead of the competition was the sheer artistry of Watterson's illustrations. In this regard, the chronological arrangement of the strips usefully shows Watterson's increasingly sophisticated technique, from his drawings of desert canyons and hideous inhabitants of alien planets, to the facial expressions of all his characters. It is hard to deny that Watterson owes a debt to Charles Schulz, whose Peanuts strip also offered a sophisticated yet deceptively simple evocation of the inner lives of children. For Calvin and Hobbes, however, Watterson combined uncanny ability, more than a touch of surrealism and a huge dose of humour to distil the essence of late-twentieth-century childhood, thereby elevating his strip into a league of its own.

On the eve of battle, Sir Thomas Lemuel Hawke of Cornwall writes a letter to his children. It is a guide on how to live well, like a knight: staying wise, humble, courageous, loving and kind. Hawke has tried to make this book look as authentic as possible. The cover stands out with a gold-embossed leaf. Inside, an editorâs note talks about the discovery of the âhistoricalâ letter, confirming Sir Thomas's death at the Battle of Slaughter Bridge in 1483.It all gives the book an important and timeless feel. Hawke has a way with a sentence, and many of the sections read like note-perfect proverbs. There are also some lovely, tender scenes with the grandfather.

This extraordinary graphic novel is so obviously a labour of love that the reader can only marvel at the energy that has been expended in its creation. Although the two plots that make up the book are essentially simple, the care with which Ware has executed them gives them an almost mythic quality. Jimmy Corrigan is a lonely, single, thirty-something with a boring job in an office cubicle, and a domineering mother who, in spite of living in a nursing home, is never far from the telephone or Jimmy. His crippling shyness renders him incapable of even saying hello to Peggy, the woman who works at an adjacent desk. When the father he has never known sends him an invitation and a plane ticket, Jimmy feels compelled to fly out to meet him. Jimmy's trip is mirrored by the boyhood tale of his grandfather, James, whose relationship with his father is tainted by unhappiness. Young James's mother has died, leaving his father with the unwanted job of bringing up the little boy alone, while at the same time maintaining his job as a glazier at the 1892 Chicago World's Fair. James is a frightened little boy, cowed by his father and bullied at school; he has a vagueness and fragility common to young, lonely and fearful children, qualities that are inherited generations later by his grandson. Chris Ware's illustrations are simply awe-inspiring in the true sense of the word. It is hard to believe that someone could put so much detail into each of the 380 pages that make up this incredible book, but there is a clue to his devotion in the afterword. After spending most of his life avoiding his own father, speaking only rarely on the phone, Ware finally met up with him: 'Gradually, the sublime outrageousness of our evening eroded into two people simply running out of things to say to each other.

Every year, the evil Protectorate offers a baby to the evil witch in the forest to ensure their villageâs safety. Yet, unknown to them, the witch is Xan, the plump and knowledgeable protector of the babies that she takes to the neighbouring village to be raised as special children, fed on starlight and destined to do wonderful things. Yet, one day, Xan feeds one baby the moon by mistake and fills her with a huge amount of magicÂ â a dangerous amount, as it turns outÂ â so Xan decides to raise Luna as her own. But nothing is straightforward, and when Luna turns 13, everything will change. Kelly Barnhill won the Newbery Medal in the US for this thoughtful and magical book about belonging, fear and family, and itâs easy to see why.

Jennifer Niven's deeply compelling and highly successful first teen novel All The Bright Places was very much for an older audience with its themes of depression and suicide. Her new book Holding Up the Universe is suitable for younger teens as well - and just as powerfully written. The book is narrated in turns by Libby, famous for once being 'America's Fattest Teen' and starting high school after years of being home schooled, and Jack, who seems to be one of the popular kids but secretly suffers from Prospagnosia - the inability to recognise the faces of familiar people even those in this own family which is often called 'face blindness'. Their worlds collide in a horribly cruel high school game and an unlikely friendship is formed that leads to something even deeper. Jennifer Niven is a gorgeous writer. Her characters Libby and Jack feel so real that it's almost impossible to believe they don't live and breathe. The author herself struggled with weight issues and anxiety over the years, particularly as a teenager, so this writing comes from the heart. The spotlight on prosopagnosia sheds an interesting light on a little known but not so uncommon condition. The ultimate message is uplifting and positive and one that teenagers everywhere need to hear: be yourself and you deserve to be wanted and loved for who you are.Â

The comic-strip adventures of Calvin, a naughty boy with a philosophical bent, and his soft toy tiger companion Hobbes, delighted readers from 1985 to 1995. The huge achievement of the comic's creator Bill Watterson is celebrated here in this wonderful cloth-bound three-volume box set, which contains in chronological order every Calvin and Hobbes strip. For those who have never experienced the sheer delight of Watterson's creation, here is a brief summary: Calvin is an active and imaginative little boy; his friend Hobbes appears as a stuffed tiger when other people are around, but when the two of them are alone he comes to life and is Calvin's friend and playmate. They live with Calvin's long-suffering parents, who have to cope with his turbulent behaviour. The charm of the strip is multi-faceted. On the one hand, Calvin is a typical six-year-old with a vivid imagination: one minute he is fearless intergalactic traveller Spaceman Spiff, crash-landing on a hostile planet, the next he is a fearsome T-Rex stalking his victim through the Jurassic jungle. He is in thrall to consumerism, hates school, loves making gruesome snowmen, and plays Calvinball, an anarchic game of ever-changing rules. Yet he is also given to philosophising about the big issues of life, ably supported or gently undermined by Hobbes's quietly caustic asides . Here is an outlet for Watterson's deeply-held views about the craziness of the modern world; indeed, the artist himself has always shunned publicity. The strip is also enhanced by its strong cast of supporting characters. Mrs Wormwood the teacher looms over Calvin when he not paying attention; the school bully is always on hand to 'pound' him; Susie, the little girl from down the road, often gets her own back on her snowball-throwing nemesis. Calvin's dad is a particularly funny creation: long-suffering, anti-media, and a proponent of fresh air, he also manages to get his revenge on his manic son by tying him up in mental knots with spurious bits of information . All these ingredients would, in the right hands, combine to make a perfectly good comic strip, but what always put Calvin and Hobbes ahead of the competition was the sheer artistry of Watterson's illustrations. In this regard, the chronological arrangement of the strips usefully shows Watterson's increasingly sophisticated technique, from his drawings of desert canyons and hideous inhabitants of alien planets, to the facial expressions of all his characters. It is hard to deny that Watterson owes a debt to Charles Schulz, whose Peanuts strip also offered a sophisticated yet deceptively simple evocation of the inner lives of children. For Calvin and Hobbes, however, Watterson combined uncanny ability, more than a touch of surrealism and a huge dose of humour to distil the essence of late-twentieth-century childhood, thereby elevating his strip into a league of its own.

This extraordinary graphic novel is so obviously a labour of love that the reader can only marvel at the energy that has been expended in its creation. Although the two plots that make up the book are essentially simple, the care with which Ware has executed them gives them an almost mythic quality. Jimmy Corrigan is a lonely, single, thirty-something with a boring job in an office cubicle, and a domineering mother who, in spite of living in a nursing home, is never far from the telephone or Jimmy. His crippling shyness renders him incapable of even saying hello to Peggy, the woman who works at an adjacent desk. When the father he has never known sends him an invitation and a plane ticket, Jimmy feels compelled to fly out to meet him. Jimmy's trip is mirrored by the boyhood tale of his grandfather, James, whose relationship with his father is tainted by unhappiness. Young James's mother has died, leaving his father with the unwanted job of bringing up the little boy alone, while at the same time maintaining his job as a glazier at the 1892 Chicago World's Fair. James is a frightened little boy, cowed by his father and bullied at school; he has a vagueness and fragility common to young, lonely and fearful children, qualities that are inherited generations later by his grandson. Chris Ware's illustrations are simply awe-inspiring in the true sense of the word. It is hard to believe that someone could put so much detail into each of the 380 pages that make up this incredible book, but there is a clue to his devotion in the afterword. After spending most of his life avoiding his own father, speaking only rarely on the phone, Ware finally met up with him: 'Gradually, the sublime outrageousness of our evening eroded into two people simply running out of things to say to each other. We weren't father and son anymore, just a pair of regretful men.'

Every year, the evil Protectorate offers a baby to the evil witch in the forest to ensure their villageâs safety. Yet, unknown to them, the witch is Xan, the plump and knowledgeable protector of the babies that she takes to the neighbouring village to be raised as special children, fed on starlight and destined to do wonderful things. Yet, one day, Xan feeds one baby the moon by mistake and fills her with a huge amount of magicÂ â a dangerous amount, as it turns outÂ â so Xan decides to raise Luna as her own. But nothing is straightforward, and when Luna turns 13, everything will change. Kelly Barnhill won the Newbery Medal in the US for this thoughtful and magical book about belonging, fear and family, and itâs easy to see why. The writing flows beautifully and Barnhillâs keen observation of human nature fits naturally into the story, which moves along at a satisfying pace. Xan is a delightfully pleasant and caring crone witch who dispels the traditional image of cackling evildoer, and replaces it with something far more loving and magical. Neil Gaiman, Ursula Le Guin and Diana Wynne Jones.

Oppel also examines Benâs teenage angst over his own personal relationships, and the ethics of animal experimentation in this absorbing novel.

Jennifer Niven's deeply compelling and highly successful first teen novel All The Bright Places was very much for an older audience with its themes of depression and suicide. Her new book Holding Up the Universe is suitable for younger teens as well - and just as powerfully written. The book is narrated in turns by Libby, famous for once being 'America's Fattest Teen' and starting high school after years of being home schooled, and Jack, who seems to be one of the popular kids but secretly suffers from Prospagnosia - the inability to recognise the faces of familiar people even those in this own family which is often called 'face blindness'. Their worlds collide in a horribly cruel high school game and an unlikely friendship is formed that leads to something even deeper. Jennifer Niven is a gorgeous writer. Her characters Libby and Jack feel so real that it's almost impossible to believe they don't live and breathe. The author herself struggled with weight issues and anxiety over the years, particularly as a teenager, so this writing comes from the heart. The spotlight on prosopagnosia sheds an interesting light on a little known but not so uncommon condition. The ultimate message is uplifting and positive and one that teenagers everywhere need to hear: be yourself and you deserve to be wanted and loved for who you are.Â

The comic-strip adventures of Calvin, a naughty boy with a philosophical bent, and his soft toy tiger companion Hobbes, delighted readers from 1985 to 1995. The huge achievement of the comic's creator Bill Watterson is celebrated here in this wonderful cloth-bound three-volume box set, which contains in chronological order every Calvin and Hobbes strip. For those who have never experienced the sheer delight of Watterson's creation, here is a brief summary: Calvin is an active and imaginative little boy; his friend Hobbes appears as a stuffed tiger when other people are around, but when the two of them are alone he comes to life and is Calvin's friend and playmate. They live with Calvin's long-suffering parents, who have to cope with his turbulent behaviour. The charm of the strip is multi-faceted. On the one hand, Calvin is a typical six-year-old with a vivid imagination: one minute he is fearless intergalactic traveller Spaceman Spiff, crash-landing on a hostile planet, the next he is a fearsome T-Rex stalking his victim through the Jurassic jungle. He is in thrall to consumerism, hates school, loves making gruesome snowmen, and plays Calvinball, an anarchic game of ever-changing rules. Yet he is also given to philosophising about the big issues of life, ably supported or gently undermined by Hobbes's quietly caustic asides . Here is an outlet for Watterson's deeply-held views about the craziness of the modern world; indeed, the artist himself has always shunned publicity. The strip is also enhanced by its strong cast of supporting characters. Mrs Wormwood the teacher looms over Calvin when he not paying attention; the school bully is always on hand to 'pound' him; Susie, the little girl from down the road, often gets her own back on her snowball-throwing nemesis. Calvin's dad is a particularly funny creation: long-suffering, anti-media, and a proponent of fresh air, he also manages to get his revenge on his manic son by tying him up in mental knots with spurious bits of information . All these ingredients would, in the right hands, combine to make a perfectly good comic strip, but what always put Calvin and Hobbes ahead of the competition was the sheer artistry of Watterson's illustrations. In this regard, the chronological arrangement of the strips usefully shows Watterson's increasingly sophisticated technique, from his drawings of desert canyons and hideous inhabitants of alien planets, to the facial expressions of all his characters. It is hard to deny that Watterson owes a debt to Charles Schulz, whose Peanuts strip also offered a sophisticated yet deceptively simple evocation of the inner lives of children. For Calvin and Hobbes, however, Watterson combined uncanny ability, more than a touch of surrealism and a huge dose of humour to distil the essence of late-twentieth-century childhood, thereby elevating his strip into a league of its own.

This extraordinary graphic novel is so obviously a labour of love that the reader can only marvel at the energy that has been expended in its creation. Although the two plots that make up the book are essentially simple, the care with which Ware has executed them gives them an almost mythic quality. Jimmy Corrigan is a lonely, single, thirty-something with a boring job in an office cubicle, and a domineering mother who, in spite of living in a nursing home, is never far from the telephone or Jimmy. His crippling shyness renders him incapable of even saying hello to Peggy, the woman who works at an adjacent desk. When the father he has never known sends him an invitation and a plane ticket, Jimmy feels compelled to fly out to meet him. Jimmy's trip is mirrored by the boyhood tale of his grandfather, James, whose relationship with his father is tainted by unhappiness. Young James's mother has died, leaving his father with the unwanted job of bringing up the little boy alone, while at the same time maintaining his job as a glazier at the 1892 Chicago World's Fair. James is a frightened little boy, cowed by his father and bullied at school; he has a vagueness and fragility common to young, lonely and fearful children, qualities that are inherited generations later by his grandson. Chris Ware's illustrations are simply awe-inspiring in the true sense of the word. It is hard to believe that someone could put so much detail into each of the 380 pages that make up this incredible book, but there is a clue to his devotion in the afterword. After spending most of his life avoiding his own father, speaking only rarely on the phone, Ware finally met up with him: 'Gradually, the sublime outrageousness of our evening eroded into two people simply running out of things to say to each other. We weren't father and son anymore, just a pair of regretful men.'

But nothing is straightforward, and when Luna turns 13, everything will change. Kelly Barnhill won the Newbery Medal in the US for this thoughtful and magical book about belonging, fear and family, and itâs easy to see why. The writing flows beautifully and Barnhillâs keen observation of human nature fits naturally into the story, which moves along at a satisfying pace. Xan is a delightfully pleasant and caring crone witch who dispels the traditional image of cackling evildoer, and replaces it with something far more loving and magical. Neil Gaiman, Ursula Le Guin and Diana Wynne Jones.

Jennifer Niven's deeply compelling and highly successful first teen novel All The Bright Places was very much for an older audience with its themes of depression and suicide. Her new book Holding Up the Universe is suitable for younger teens as well - and just as powerfully written. The book is narrated in turns by Libby, famous for once being 'America's Fattest Teen' and starting high school after years of being home schooled, and Jack, who seems to be one of the popular kids but secretly suffers from Prospagnosia - the inability to recognise the faces of familiar people even those in this own family which is often called 'face blindness'. Their worlds collide in a horribly cruel high school game and an unlikely friendship is formed that leads to something even deeper. Jennifer Niven is a gorgeous writer. Her characters Libby and Jack feel so real that it's almost impossible to believe they don't live and breathe. The author herself struggled with weight issues and anxiety over the years, particularly as a teenager, so this writing comes from the heart. The spotlight on prosopagnosia sheds an interesting light on a little known but not so uncommon condition. The ultimate message is uplifting and positive and one that teenagers everywhere need to hear: be yourself and you deserve to be wanted and loved for who you are.Â

The comic-strip adventures of Calvin, a naughty boy with a philosophical bent, and his soft toy tiger companion Hobbes, delighted readers from 1985 to 1995. The huge achievement of the comic's creator Bill Watterson is celebrated here in this wonderful cloth-bound three-volume box set, which contains in chronological order every Calvin and Hobbes strip. For those who have never experienced the sheer delight of Watterson's creation, here is a brief summary: Calvin is an active and imaginative little boy; his friend Hobbes appears as a stuffed tiger when other people are around, but when the two of them are alone he comes to life and is Calvin's friend and playmate. They live with Calvin's long-suffering parents, who have to cope with his turbulent behaviour. The charm of the strip is multi-faceted. On the one hand, Calvin is a typical six-year-old with a vivid imagination: one minute he is fearless intergalactic traveller Spaceman Spiff, crash-landing on a hostile planet, the next he is a fearsome T-Rex stalking his victim through the Jurassic jungle. He is in thrall to consumerism, hates school, loves making gruesome snowmen, and plays Calvinball, an anarchic game of ever-changing rules. Yet he is also given to philosophising about the big issues of life, ably supported or gently undermined by Hobbes's quietly caustic asides . Here is an outlet for Watterson's deeply-held views about the craziness of the modern world; indeed, the artist himself has always shunned publicity. The strip is also enhanced by its strong cast of supporting characters. Mrs Wormwood the teacher looms over Calvin when he not paying attention; the school bully is always on hand to 'pound' him; Susie, the little girl from down the road, often gets her own back on her snowball-throwing nemesis. Calvin's dad is a particularly funny creation: long-suffering, anti-media, and a proponent of fresh air, he also manages to get his revenge on his manic son by tying him up in mental knots with spurious bits of information . All these ingredients would, in the right hands, combine to make a perfectly good comic strip, but what always put Calvin and Hobbes ahead of the competition was the sheer artistry of Watterson's illustrations. In this regard, the chronological arrangement of the strips usefully shows Watterson's increasingly sophisticated technique, from his drawings of desert canyons and hideous inhabitants of alien planets, to the facial expressions of all his characters. It is hard to deny that Watterson owes a debt to Charles Schulz, whose Peanuts strip also offered a sophisticated yet deceptively simple evocation of the inner lives of children. For Calvin and Hobbes, however, Watterson combined uncanny ability, more than a touch of surrealism and a huge dose of humour to distil the essence of late-twentieth-century childhood, thereby elevating his strip into a league of its own.

Oppel also examines Benâs teenage angst over his own personal relationships, and the ethics of animal experimentation in this absorbing novel.

Jennifer Niven's deeply compelling and highly successful first teen novel All The Bright Places was very much for an older audience with its themes of depression and suicide. Her new book Holding Up the Universe is suitable for younger teens as well - and just as powerfully written. The book is narrated in turns by Libby, famous for once being 'America's Fattest Teen' and starting high school after years of being home schooled, and Jack, who seems to be one of the popular kids but secretly suffers from Prospagnosia - the inability to recognise the faces of familiar people even those in this own family which is often called 'face blindness'. Their worlds collide in a horribly cruel high school game and an unlikely friendship is formed that leads to something even deeper. Jennifer Niven is a gorgeous writer. Her characters Libby and Jack feel so real that it's almost impossible to believe they don't live and breathe. The author herself struggled with weight issues and anxiety over the years, particularly as a teenager, so this writing comes from the heart. The spotlight on prosopagnosia sheds an interesting light on a little known but not so uncommon condition. The ultimate message is uplifting and positive and one that teenagers everywhere need to hear: be yourself and you deserve to be wanted and loved for who you are.Â

The comic-strip adventures of Calvin, a naughty boy with a philosophical bent, and his soft toy tiger companion Hobbes, delighted readers from 1985 to 1995. The huge achievement of the comic's creator Bill Watterson is celebrated here in this wonderful cloth-bound three-volume box set, which contains in chronological order every Calvin and Hobbes strip. For those who have never experienced the sheer delight of Watterson's creation, here is a brief summary: Calvin is an active and imaginative little boy; his friend Hobbes appears as a stuffed tiger when other people are around, but when the two of them are alone he comes to life and is Calvin's friend and playmate. They live with Calvin's long-suffering parents, who have to cope with his turbulent behaviour. The charm of the strip is multi-faceted. On the one hand, Calvin is a typical six-year-old with a vivid imagination: one minute he is fearless intergalactic traveller Spaceman Spiff, crash-landing on a hostile planet, the next he is a fearsome T-Rex stalking his victim through the Jurassic jungle. He is in thrall to consumerism, hates school, loves making gruesome snowmen, and plays Calvinball, an anarchic game of ever-changing rules. Yet he is also given to philosophising about the big issues of life, ably supported or gently undermined by Hobbes's quietly caustic asides . Here is an outlet for Watterson's deeply-held views about the craziness of the modern world; indeed, the artist himself has always shunned publicity. The strip is also enhanced by its strong cast of supporting characters. Mrs Wormwood the teacher looms over Calvin when he not paying attention; the school bully is always on hand to 'pound' him; Susie, the little girl from down the road, often gets her own back on her snowball-throwing nemesis. Calvin's dad is a particularly funny creation: long-suffering, anti-media, and a proponent of fresh air, he also manages to get his revenge on his manic son by tying him up in mental knots with spurious bits of information . All these ingredients would, in the right hands, combine to make a perfectly good comic strip, but what always put Calvin and Hobbes ahead of the competition was the sheer artistry of Watterson's illustrations. In this regard, the chronological arrangement of the strips usefully shows Watterson's increasingly sophisticated technique, from his drawings of desert canyons and hideous inhabitants of alien planets, to the facial expressions of all his characters. It is hard to deny that Watterson owes a debt to Charles Schulz, whose Peanuts strip also offered a sophisticated yet deceptively simple evocation of the inner lives of children. For Calvin and Hobbes, however, Watterson combined uncanny ability, more than a touch of surrealism and a huge dose of humour to distil the essence of late-twentieth-century childhood, thereby elevating his strip into a league of its own.

This extraordinary graphic novel is so obviously a labour of love that the reader can only marvel at the energy that has been expended in its creation. Although the two plots that make up the book are essentially simple, the care with which Ware has executed them gives them an almost mythic quality. Jimmy Corrigan is a lonely, single, thirty-something with a boring job in an office cubicle, and a domineering mother who, in spite of living in a nursing home, is never far from the telephone or Jimmy. His crippling shyness renders him incapable of even saying hello to Peggy, the woman who works at an adjacent desk. When the father he has never known sends him an invitation and a plane ticket, Jimmy feels compelled to fly out to meet him. Jimmy's trip is mirrored by the boyhood tale of his grandfather, James, whose relationship with his father is tainted by unhappiness. Young James's mother has died, leaving his father with the unwanted job of bringing up the little boy alone, while at the same time maintaining his job as a glazier at the 1892 Chicago World's Fair. James is a frightened little boy, cowed by his father and bullied at school; he has a vagueness and fragility common to young, lonely and fearful children, qualities that are inherited generations later by his grandson. Chris Ware's illustrations are simply awe-inspiring in the true sense of the word. It is hard to believe that someone could put so much detail into each of the 380 pages that make up this incredible book, but there is a clue to his devotion in the afterword. After spending most of his life avoiding his own father, speaking only rarely on the phone, Ware finally met up with him: 'Gradually, the sublime outrageousness of our evening eroded into two people simply running out of things to say to each other. We weren't father and son anymore, just a pair of regretful men.'

Oppel also examines Benâs teenage angst over his own personal relationships, and the ethics of animal experimentation in this absorbing novel.

Jennifer Niven's deeply compelling and highly successful first teen novel All The Bright Places was very much for an older audience with its themes of depression and suicide. Her new book Holding Up the Universe is suitable for younger teens as well - and just as powerfully written. The book is narrated in turns by Libby, famous for once being 'America's Fattest Teen' and starting high school after years of being home schooled, and Jack, who seems to be one of the popular kids but secretly suffers from Prospagnosia - the inability to recognise the faces of familiar people even those in this own family which is often called 'face blindness'. Their worlds collide in a horribly cruel high school game and an unlikely friendship is formed that leads to something even deeper. Jennifer Niven is a gorgeous writer. Her characters Libby and Jack feel so real that it's almost impossible to believe they don't live and breathe. The author herself struggled with weight issues and anxiety over the years, particularly as a teenager, so this writing comes from the heart. The spotlight on prosopagnosia sheds an interesting light on a little known but not so uncommon condition. The ultimate message is uplifting and positive and one that teenagers everywhere need to hear: be yourself and you deserve to be wanted and loved for who you are.Â

The comic-strip adventures of Calvin, a naughty boy with a philosophical bent, and his soft toy tiger companion Hobbes, delighted readers from 1985 to 1995. The huge achievement of the comic's creator Bill Watterson is celebrated here in this wonderful cloth-bound three-volume box set, which contains in chronological order every Calvin and Hobbes strip. For those who have never experienced the sheer delight of Watterson's creation, here is a brief summary: Calvin is an active and imaginative little boy; his friend Hobbes appears as a stuffed tiger when other people are around, but when the two of them are alone he comes to life and is Calvin's friend and playmate. They live with Calvin's long-suffering parents, who have to cope with his turbulent behaviour. The charm of the strip is multi-faceted. On the one hand, Calvin is a typical six-year-old with a vivid imagination: one minute he is fearless intergalactic traveller Spaceman Spiff, crash-landing on a hostile planet, the next he is a fearsome T-Rex stalking his victim through the Jurassic jungle. He is in thrall to consumerism, hates school, loves making gruesome snowmen, and plays Calvinball, an anarchic game of ever-changing rules. Yet he is also given to philosophising about the big issues of life, ably supported or gently undermined by Hobbes's quietly caustic asides . Here is an outlet for Watterson's deeply-held views about the craziness of the modern world; indeed, the artist himself has always shunned publicity. The strip is also enhanced by its strong cast of supporting characters. Mrs Wormwood the teacher looms over Calvin when he not paying attention; the school bully is always on hand to 'pound' him; Susie, the little girl from down the road, often gets her own back on her snowball-throwing nemesis. Calvin's dad is a particularly funny creation: long-suffering, anti-media, and a proponent of fresh air, he also manages to get his revenge on his manic son by tying him up in mental knots with spurious bits of information . All these ingredients would, in the right hands, combine to make a perfectly good comic strip, but what always put Calvin and Hobbes ahead of the competition was the sheer artistry of Watterson's illustrations. In this regard, the chronological arrangement of the strips usefully shows Watterson's increasingly sophisticated technique, from his drawings of desert canyons and hideous inhabitants of alien planets, to the facial expressions of all his characters. It is hard to deny that Watterson owes a debt to Charles Schulz, whose Peanuts strip also offered a sophisticated yet deceptively simple evocation of the inner lives of children. For Calvin and Hobbes, however, Watterson combined uncanny ability, more than a touch of surrealism and a huge dose of humour to distil the essence of late-twentieth-century childhood, thereby elevating his strip into a league of its own.

On the eve of battle, Sir Thomas Lemuel Hawke of Cornwall writes a letter to his children. It is a guide on how to live well, like a knight: staying wise, humble, courageous, loving and kind.

This extraordinary graphic novel is so obviously a labour of love that the reader can only marvel at the energy that has been expended in its creation. Although the two plots that make up the book are essentially simple, the care with which Ware has executed them gives them an almost mythic quality. Jimmy Corrigan is a lonely, single, thirty-something with a boring job in an office cubicle, and a domineering mother who, in spite of living in a nursing home, is never far from the telephone or Jimmy. His crippling shyness renders him incapable of even saying hello to Peggy, the woman who works at an adjacent desk. When the father he has never known sends him an invitation and a plane ticket, Jimmy feels compelled to fly out to meet him. Jimmy's trip is mirrored by the boyhood tale of his grandfather, James, whose relationship with his father is tainted by unhappiness. Young James's mother has died, leaving his father with the unwanted job of bringing up the little boy alone, while at the same time maintaining his job as a glazier at the 1892 Chicago World's Fair. James is a frightened little boy, cowed by his father and bullied at school; he has a vagueness and fragility common to young, lonely and fearful children, qualities that are inherited generations later by his grandson. Chris Ware's illustrations are simply awe-inspiring in the true sense of the word. It is hard to believe that someone could put so much detail into each of the 380 pages that make up this incredible book, but there is a clue to his devotion in the afterword. After spending most of his life avoiding his own father, speaking only rarely on the phone, Ware finally met up with him: 'Gradually, the sublime outrageousness of our evening eroded into two people simply running out of things to say to each other. We weren't father and son anymore, just a pair of regretful men.'

Oppel bases his first YA novel on projects in the 1970s which tested the capability of chimpanzees to acquire sign language.

Readers are drawn into the tension between the emotional bond which Ben and his mother form with Zan, the demands of the research which dominate the attitude of Ben's more inhibited father, and the increasingly fraught relationship he has with his wife and son. Oppel also examines Benâs teenage angst over his own personal relationships, and the ethics of animal experimentation in this absorbing novel.

Jennifer Niven's deeply compelling and highly successful first teen novel All The Bright Places was very much for an older audience with its themes of depression and suicide. Her new book Holding Up the Universe is suitable for younger teens as well - and just as powerfully written. The book is narrated in turns by Libby, famous for once being 'America's Fattest Teen' and starting high school after years of being home schooled, and Jack, who seems to be one of the popular kids but secretly suffers from Prospagnosia - the inability to recognise the faces of familiar people even those in this own family which is often called 'face blindness'. Their worlds collide in a horribly cruel high school game and an unlikely friendship is formed that leads to something even deeper. Jennifer Niven is a gorgeous writer. Her characters Libby and Jack feel so real that it's almost impossible to believe they don't live and breathe. The author herself struggled with weight issues and anxiety over the years, particularly as a teenager, so this writing comes from the heart. The spotlight on prosopagnosia sheds an interesting light on a little known but not so uncommon condition. The ultimate message is uplifting and positive and one that teenagers everywhere need to hear: be yourself and you deserve to be wanted and loved for who you are.Â

The comic-strip adventures of Calvin, a naughty boy with a philosophical bent, and his soft toy tiger companion Hobbes, delighted readers from 1985 to 1995. The huge achievement of the comic's creator Bill Watterson is celebrated here in this wonderful cloth-bound three-volume box set, which contains in chronological order every Calvin and Hobbes strip. For those who have never experienced the sheer delight of Watterson's creation, here is a brief summary: Calvin is an active and imaginative little boy; his friend Hobbes appears as a stuffed tiger when other people are around, but when the two of them are alone he comes to life and is Calvin's friend and playmate. They live with Calvin's long-suffering parents, who have to cope with his turbulent behaviour. The charm of the strip is multi-faceted. On the one hand, Calvin is a typical six-year-old with a vivid imagination: one minute he is fearless intergalactic traveller Spaceman Spiff, crash-landing on a hostile planet, the next he is a fearsome T-Rex stalking his victim through the Jurassic jungle. He is in thrall to consumerism, hates school, loves making gruesome snowmen, and plays Calvinball, an anarchic game of ever-changing rules. Yet he is also given to philosophising about the big issues of life, ably supported or gently undermined by Hobbes's quietly caustic asides . Here is an outlet for Watterson's deeply-held views about the craziness of the modern world; indeed, the artist himself has always shunned publicity. The strip is also enhanced by its strong cast of supporting characters. Mrs Wormwood the teacher looms over Calvin when he not paying attention; the school bully is always on hand to 'pound' him; Susie, the little girl from down the road, often gets her own back on her snowball-throwing nemesis. Calvin's dad is a particularly funny creation: long-suffering, anti-media, and a proponent of fresh air, he also manages to get his revenge on his manic son by tying him up in mental knots with spurious bits of information . All these ingredients would, in the right hands, combine to make a perfectly good comic strip, but what always put Calvin and Hobbes ahead of the competition was the sheer artistry of Watterson's illustrations. In this regard, the chronological arrangement of the strips usefully shows Watterson's increasingly sophisticated technique, from his drawings of desert canyons and hideous inhabitants of alien planets, to the facial expressions of all his characters. It is hard to deny that Watterson owes a debt to Charles Schulz, whose Peanuts strip also offered a sophisticated yet deceptively simple evocation of the inner lives of children. For Calvin and Hobbes, however, Watterson combined uncanny ability, more than a touch of surrealism and a huge dose of humour to distil the essence of late-twentieth-century childhood, thereby elevating his strip into a league of its own.

This extraordinary graphic novel is so obviously a labour of love that the reader can only marvel at the energy that has been expended in its creation. Although the two plots that make up the book are essentially simple, the care with which Ware has executed them gives them an almost mythic quality. Jimmy Corrigan is a lonely, single, thirty-something with a boring job in an office cubicle, and a domineering mother who, in spite of living in a nursing home, is never far from the telephone or Jimmy. His crippling shyness renders him incapable of even saying hello to Peggy, the woman who works at an adjacent desk. When the father he has never known sends him an invitation and a plane ticket, Jimmy feels compelled to fly out to meet him. Jimmy's trip is mirrored by the boyhood tale of his grandfather, James, whose relationship with his father is tainted by unhappiness. Young James's mother has died, leaving his father with the unwanted job of bringing up the little boy alone, while at the same time maintaining his job as a glazier at the 1892 Chicago World's Fair. James is a frightened little boy, cowed by his father and bullied at school; he has a vagueness and fragility common to young, lonely and fearful children, qualities that are inherited generations later by his grandson. Chris Ware's illustrations are simply awe-inspiring in the true sense of the word. It is hard to believe that someone could put so much detail into each of the 380 pages that make up this incredible book, but there is a clue to his devotion in the afterword. After spending most of his life avoiding his own father, speaking only rarely on the phone, Ware finally met up with him: 'Gradually, the sublime outrageousness of our evening eroded into two people simply running out of things to say to each other. We weren't father and son anymore, just a pair of regretful men.'

Oppel also examines Benâs teenage angst over his own personal relationships, and the ethics of animal experimentation in this absorbing novel.

Jennifer Niven's deeply compelling and highly successful first teen novel All The Bright Places was very much for an older audience with its themes of depression and suicide. Her new book Holding Up the Universe is suitable for younger teens as well - and just as powerfully written. The book is narrated in turns by Libby, famous for once being 'America's Fattest Teen' and starting high school after years of being home schooled, and Jack, who seems to be one of the popular kids but secretly suffers from Prospagnosia - the inability to recognise the faces of familiar people even those in this own family which is often called 'face blindness'. Their worlds collide in a horribly cruel high school game and an unlikely friendship is formed that leads to something even deeper. Jennifer Niven is a gorgeous writer. Her characters Libby and Jack feel so real that it's almost impossible to believe they don't live and breathe. The author herself struggled with weight issues and anxiety over the years, particularly as a teenager, so this writing comes from the heart. The spotlight on prosopagnosia sheds an interesting light on a little known but not so uncommon condition. The ultimate message is uplifting and positive and one that teenagers everywhere need to hear: be yourself and you deserve to be wanted and loved for who you are.Â

The comic-strip adventures of Calvin, a naughty boy with a philosophical bent, and his soft toy tiger companion Hobbes, delighted readers from 1985 to 1995. The huge achievement of the comic's creator Bill Watterson is celebrated here in this wonderful cloth-bound three-volume box set, which contains in chronological order every Calvin and Hobbes strip. For those who have never experienced the sheer delight of Watterson's creation, here is a brief summary: Calvin is an active and imaginative little boy; his friend Hobbes appears as a stuffed tiger when other people are around, but when the two of them are alone he comes to life and is Calvin's friend and playmate. They live with Calvin's long-suffering parents, who have to cope with his turbulent behaviour. The charm of the strip is multi-faceted. On the one hand, Calvin is a typical six-year-old with a vivid imagination: one minute he is fearless intergalactic traveller Spaceman Spiff, crash-landing on a hostile planet, the next he is a fearsome T-Rex stalking his victim through the Jurassic jungle. He is in thrall to consumerism, hates school, loves making gruesome snowmen, and plays Calvinball, an anarchic game of ever-changing rules. Yet he is also given to philosophising about the big issues of life, ably supported or gently undermined by Hobbes's quietly caustic asides . Here is an outlet for Watterson's deeply-held views about the craziness of the modern world; indeed, the artist himself has always shunned publicity. The strip is also enhanced by its strong cast of supporting characters. Mrs Wormwood the teacher looms over Calvin when he not paying attention; the school bully is always on hand to 'pound' him; Susie, the little girl from down the road, often gets her own back on her snowball-throwing nemesis. Calvin's dad is a particularly funny creation: long-suffering, anti-media, and a proponent of fresh air, he also manages to get his revenge on his manic son by tying him up in mental knots with spurious bits of information . All these ingredients would, in the right hands, combine to make a perfectly good comic strip, but what always put Calvin and Hobbes ahead of the competition was the sheer artistry of Watterson's illustrations. In this regard, the chronological arrangement of the strips usefully shows Watterson's increasingly sophisticated technique, from his drawings of desert canyons and hideous inhabitants of alien planets, to the facial expressions of all his characters. It is hard to deny that Watterson owes a debt to Charles Schulz, whose Peanuts strip also offered a sophisticated yet deceptively simple evocation of the inner lives of children. For Calvin and Hobbes, however, Watterson combined uncanny ability, more than a touch of surrealism and a huge dose of humour to distil the essence of late-twentieth-century childhood, thereby elevating his strip into a league of its own.

This extraordinary graphic novel is so obviously a labour of love that the reader can only marvel at the energy that has been expended in its creation. Although the two plots that make up the book are essentially simple, the care with which Ware has executed them gives them an almost mythic quality. Jimmy Corrigan is a lonely, single, thirty-something with a boring job in an office cubicle, and a domineering mother who, in spite of living in a nursing home, is never far from the telephone or Jimmy. His crippling shyness renders him incapable of even saying hello to Peggy, the woman who works at an adjacent desk. When the father he has never known sends him an invitation and a plane ticket, Jimmy feels compelled to fly out to meet him. Jimmy's trip is mirrored by the boyhood tale of his grandfather, James, whose relationship with his father is tainted by unhappiness. Young James's mother has died, leaving his father with the unwanted job of bringing up the little boy alone, while at the same time maintaining his job as a glazier at the 1892 Chicago World's Fair. James is a frightened little boy, cowed by his father and bullied at school; he has a vagueness and fragility common to young, lonely and fearful children, qualities that are inherited generations later by his grandson. Chris Ware's illustrations are simply awe-inspiring in the true sense of the word. It is hard to believe that someone could put so much detail into each of the 380 pages that make up this incredible book, but there is a clue to his devotion in the afterword. After spending most of his life avoiding his own father, speaking only rarely on the phone, Ware finally met up with him: 'Gradually, the sublime outrageousness of our evening eroded into two people simply running out of things to say to each other. We weren't father and son anymore, just a pair of regretful men.'

Oppel bases his first YA novel on projects in the 1970s which tested the capability of chimpanzees to acquire sign language.

Oppel also examines Benâs teenage angst over his own personal relationships, and the ethics of animal experimentation in this absorbing novel.

Jennifer Niven's deeply compelling and highly successful first teen novel All The Bright Places was very much for an older audience with its themes of depression and suicide. Her new book Holding Up the Universe is suitable for younger teens as well - and just as powerfully written. The book is narrated in turns by Libby, famous for once being 'America's Fattest Teen' and starting high school after years of being home schooled, and Jack, who seems to be one of the popular kids but secretly suffers from Prospagnosia - the inability to recognise the faces of familiar people even those in this own family which is often called 'face blindness'. Their worlds collide in a horribly cruel high school game and an unlikely friendship is formed that leads to something even deeper. Jennifer Niven is a gorgeous writer. Her characters Libby and Jack feel so real that it's almost impossible to believe they don't live and breathe. The author herself struggled with weight issues and anxiety over the years, particularly as a teenager, so this writing comes from the heart. The spotlight on prosopagnosia sheds an interesting light on a little known but not so uncommon condition. The ultimate message is uplifting and positive and one that teenagers everywhere need to hear: be yourself and you deserve to be wanted and loved for who you are.Â

The comic-strip adventures of Calvin, a naughty boy with a philosophical bent, and his soft toy tiger companion Hobbes, delighted readers from 1985 to 1995. The huge achievement of the comic's creator Bill Watterson is celebrated here in this wonderful cloth-bound three-volume box set, which contains in chronological order every Calvin and Hobbes strip. For those who have never experienced the sheer delight of Watterson's creation, here is a brief summary: Calvin is an active and imaginative little boy; his friend Hobbes appears as a stuffed tiger when other people are around, but when the two of them are alone he comes to life and is Calvin's friend and playmate. They live with Calvin's long-suffering parents, who have to cope with his turbulent behaviour. The charm of the strip is multi-faceted. On the one hand, Calvin is a typical six-year-old with a vivid imagination: one minute he is fearless intergalactic traveller Spaceman Spiff, crash-landing on a hostile planet, the next he is a fearsome T-Rex stalking his victim through the Jurassic jungle. He is in thrall to consumerism, hates school, loves making gruesome snowmen, and plays Calvinball, an anarchic game of ever-changing rules. Yet he is also given to philosophising about the big issues of life, ably supported or gently undermined by Hobbes's quietly caustic asides . Here is an outlet for Watterson's deeply-held views about the craziness of the modern world; indeed, the artist himself has always shunned publicity. The strip is also enhanced by its strong cast of supporting characters. Mrs Wormwood the teacher looms over Calvin when he not paying attention; the school bully is always on hand to 'pound' him; Susie, the little girl from down the road, often gets her own back on her snowball-throwing nemesis. Calvin's dad is a particularly funny creation: long-suffering, anti-media, and a proponent of fresh air, he also manages to get his revenge on his manic son by tying him up in mental knots with spurious bits of information . All these ingredients would, in the right hands, combine to make a perfectly good comic strip, but what always put Calvin and Hobbes ahead of the competition was the sheer artistry of Watterson's illustrations. In this regard, the chronological arrangement of the strips usefully shows Watterson's increasingly sophisticated technique, from his drawings of desert canyons and hideous inhabitants of alien planets, to the facial expressions of all his characters. It is hard to deny that Watterson owes a debt to Charles Schulz, whose Peanuts strip also offered a sophisticated yet deceptively simple evocation of the inner lives of children. For Calvin and Hobbes, however, Watterson combined uncanny ability, more than a touch of surrealism and a huge dose of humour to distil the essence of late-twentieth-century childhood, thereby elevating his strip into a league of its own.

This extraordinary graphic novel is so obviously a labour of love that the reader can only marvel at the energy that has been expended in its creation. Although the two plots that make up the book are essentially simple, the care with which Ware has executed them gives them an almost mythic quality. Jimmy Corrigan is a lonely, single, thirty-something with a boring job in an office cubicle, and a domineering mother who, in spite of living in a nursing home, is never far from the telephone or Jimmy. His crippling shyness renders him incapable of even saying hello to Peggy, the woman who works at an adjacent desk. When the father he has never known sends him an invitation and a plane ticket, Jimmy feels compelled to fly out to meet him. Jimmy's trip is mirrored by the boyhood tale of his grandfather, James, whose relationship with his father is tainted by unhappiness. Young James's mother has died, leaving his father with the unwanted job of bringing up the little boy alone, while at the same time maintaining his job as a glazier at the 1892 Chicago World's Fair. James is a frightened little boy, cowed by his father and bullied at school; he has a vagueness and fragility common to young, lonely and fearful children, qualities that are inherited generations later by his grandson. Chris Ware's illustrations are simply awe-inspiring in the true sense of the word. It is hard to believe that someone could put so much detail into each of the 380 pages that make up this incredible book, but there is a clue to his devotion in the afterword. After spending most of his life avoiding his own father, speaking only rarely on the phone, Ware finally met up with him: 'Gradually, the sublime outrageousness of our evening eroded into two people simply running out of things to say to each other. We weren't father and son anymore, just a pair of regretful men.'

Oppel also examines Benâs teenage angst over his own personal relationships, and the ethics of animal experimentation in this absorbing novel.

Jennifer Niven's deeply compelling and highly successful first teen novel All The Bright Places was very much for an older audience with its themes of depression and suicide. Her new book Holding Up the Universe is suitable for younger teens as well - and just as powerfully written. The book is narrated in turns by Libby, famous for once being 'America's Fattest Teen' and starting high school after years of being home schooled, and Jack, who seems to be one of the popular kids but secretly suffers from Prospagnosia - the inability to recognise the faces of familiar people even those in this own family which is often called 'face blindness'. Their worlds collide in a horribly cruel high school game and an unlikely friendship is formed that leads to something even deeper. Jennifer Niven is a gorgeous writer. Her characters Libby and Jack feel so real that it's almost impossible to believe they don't live and breathe. The author herself struggled with weight issues and anxiety over the years, particularly as a teenager, so this writing comes from the heart. The spotlight on prosopagnosia sheds an interesting light on a little known but not so uncommon condition. The ultimate message is uplifting and positive and one that teenagers everywhere need to hear: be yourself and you deserve to be wanted and loved for who you are.Â

The comic-strip adventures of Calvin, a naughty boy with a philosophical bent, and his soft toy tiger companion Hobbes, delighted readers from 1985 to 1995. The huge achievement of the comic's creator Bill Watterson is celebrated here in this wonderful cloth-bound three-volume box set, which contains in chronological order every Calvin and Hobbes strip. For those who have never experienced the sheer delight of Watterson's creation, here is a brief summary: Calvin is an active and imaginative little boy; his friend Hobbes appears as a stuffed tiger when other people are around, but when the two of them are alone he comes to life and is Calvin's friend and playmate. They live with Calvin's long-suffering parents, who have to cope with his turbulent behaviour. The charm of the strip is multi-faceted. On the one hand, Calvin is a typical six-year-old with a vivid imagination: one minute he is fearless intergalactic traveller Spaceman Spiff, crash-landing on a hostile planet, the next he is a fearsome T-Rex stalking his victim through the Jurassic jungle. He is in thrall to consumerism, hates school, loves making gruesome snowmen, and plays Calvinball, an anarchic game of ever-changing rules. Yet he is also given to philosophising about the big issues of life, ably supported or gently undermined by Hobbes's quietly caustic asides . Here is an outlet for Watterson's deeply-held views about the craziness of the modern world; indeed, the artist himself has always shunned publicity. The strip is also enhanced by its strong cast of supporting characters. Mrs Wormwood the teacher looms over Calvin when he not paying attention; the school bully is always on hand to 'pound' him; Susie, the little girl from down the road, often gets her own back on her snowball-throwing nemesis. Calvin's dad is a particularly funny creation: long-suffering, anti-media, and a proponent of fresh air, he also manages to get his revenge on his manic son by tying him up in mental knots with spurious bits of information . All these ingredients would, in the right hands, combine to make a perfectly good comic strip, but what always put Calvin and Hobbes ahead of the competition was the sheer artistry of Watterson's illustrations. In this regard, the chronological arrangement of the strips usefully shows Watterson's increasingly sophisticated technique, from his drawings of desert canyons and hideous inhabitants of alien planets, to the facial expressions of all his characters. It is hard to deny that Watterson owes a debt to Charles Schulz, whose Peanuts strip also offered a sophisticated yet deceptively simple evocation of the inner lives of children. For Calvin and Hobbes, however, Watterson combined uncanny ability, more than a touch of surrealism and a huge dose of humour to distil the essence of late-twentieth-century childhood, thereby elevating his strip into a league of its own.

On the eve of battle, Sir Thomas Lemuel Hawke of Cornwall writes a letter to his children. It is a guide on how to live well, like a knight: staying wise, humble, courageous, loving and kind.

This extraordinary graphic novel is so obviously a labour of love that the reader can only marvel at the energy that has been expended in its creation. Although the two plots that make up the book are essentially simple, the care with which Ware has executed them gives them an almost mythic quality. Jimmy Corrigan is a lonely, single, thirty-something with a boring job in an office cubicle, and a domineering mother who, in spite of living in a nursing home, is never far from the telephone or Jimmy. His crippling shyness renders him incapable of even saying hello to Peggy, the woman who works at an adjacent desk. When the father he has never known sends him an invitation and a plane ticket, Jimmy feels compelled to fly out to meet him. Jimmy's trip is mirrored by the boyhood tale of his grandfather, James, whose relationship with his father is tainted by unhappiness. Young James's mother has died, leaving his father with the unwanted job of bringing up the little boy alone, while at the same time maintaining his job as a glazier at the 1892 Chicago World's Fair. James is a frightened little boy, cowed by his father and bullied at school; he has a vagueness and fragility common to young, lonely and fearful children, qualities that are inherited generations later by his grandson. Chris Ware's illustrations are simply awe-inspiring in the true sense of the word. It is hard to believe that someone could put so much detail into each of the 380 pages that make up this incredible book, but there is a clue to his devotion in the afterword. After spending most of his life avoiding his own father, speaking only rarely on the phone, Ware finally met up with him: 'Gradually, the sublime outrageousness of our evening eroded into two people simply running out of things to say to each other. We weren't father and son anymore, just a pair of regretful men.'

Oppel bases his first YA novel on projects in the 1970s which tested the capability of chimpanzees to acquire sign language.

Readers are drawn into the tension between the emotional bond which Ben and his mother form with Zan, the demands of the research which dominate the attitude of Ben's more inhibited father, and the increasingly fraught relationship he has with his wife and son. Oppel also examines Benâs teenage angst over his own personal relationships, and the ethics of animal experimentation in this absorbing novel.

Jennifer Niven's deeply compelling and highly successful first teen novel All The Bright Places was very much for an older audience with its themes of depression and suicide. Her new book Holding Up the Universe is suitable for younger teens as well - and just as powerfully written. The book is narrated in turns by Libby, famous for once being 'America's Fattest Teen' and starting high school after years of being home schooled, and Jack, who seems to be one of the popular kids but secretly suffers from Prospagnosia - the inability to recognise the faces of familiar people even those in this own family which is often called 'face blindness'. Their worlds collide in a horribly cruel high school game and an unlikely friendship is formed that leads to something even deeper. Jennifer Niven is a gorgeous writer. Her characters Libby and Jack feel so real that it's almost impossible to believe they don't live and breathe. The author herself struggled with weight issues and anxiety over the years, particularly as a teenager, so this writing comes from the heart. The spotlight on prosopagnosia sheds an interesting light on a little known but not so uncommon condition. The ultimate message is uplifting and positive and one that teenagers everywhere need to hear: be yourself and you deserve to be wanted and loved for who you are.Â

The comic-strip adventures of Calvin, a naughty boy with a philosophical bent, and his soft toy tiger companion Hobbes, delighted readers from 1985 to 1995. The huge achievement of the comic's creator Bill Watterson is celebrated here in this wonderful cloth-bound three-volume box set, which contains in chronological order every Calvin and Hobbes strip. For those who have never experienced the sheer delight of Watterson's creation, here is a brief summary: Calvin is an active and imaginative little boy; his friend Hobbes appears as a stuffed tiger when other people are around, but when the two of them are alone he comes to life and is Calvin's friend and playmate. They live with Calvin's long-suffering parents, who have to cope with his turbulent behaviour. The charm of the strip is multi-faceted. On the one hand, Calvin is a typical six-year-old with a vivid imagination: one minute he is fearless intergalactic traveller Spaceman Spiff, crash-landing on a hostile planet, the next he is a fearsome T-Rex stalking his victim through the Jurassic jungle. He is in thrall to consumerism, hates school, loves making gruesome snowmen, and plays Calvinball, an anarchic game of ever-changing rules. Yet he is also given to philosophising about the big issues of life, ably supported or gently undermined by Hobbes's quietly caustic asides . Here is an outlet for Watterson's deeply-held views about the craziness of the modern world; indeed, the artist himself has always shunned publicity. The strip is also enhanced by its strong cast of supporting characters. Mrs Wormwood the teacher looms over Calvin when he not paying attention; the school bully is always on hand to 'pound' him; Susie, the little girl from down the road, often gets her own back on her snowball-throwing nemesis. Calvin's dad is a particularly funny creation: long-suffering, anti-media, and a proponent of fresh air, he also manages to get his revenge on his manic son by tying him up in mental knots with spurious bits of information . All these ingredients would, in the right hands, combine to make a perfectly good comic strip, but what always put Calvin and Hobbes ahead of the competition was the sheer artistry of Watterson's illustrations. In this regard, the chronological arrangement of the strips usefully shows Watterson's increasingly sophisticated technique, from his drawings of desert canyons and hideous inhabitants of alien planets, to the facial expressions of all his characters. It is hard to deny that Watterson owes a debt to Charles Schulz, whose Peanuts strip also offered a sophisticated yet deceptively simple evocation of the inner lives of children. For Calvin and Hobbes, however, Watterson combined uncanny ability, more than a touch of surrealism and a huge dose of humour to distil the essence of late-twentieth-century childhood, thereby elevating his strip into a league of its own.

This extraordinary graphic novel is so obviously a labour of love that the reader can only marvel at the energy that has been expended in its creation. Although the two plots that make up the book are essentially simple, the care with which Ware has executed them gives them an almost mythic quality. Jimmy Corrigan is a lonely, single, thirty-something with a boring job in an office cubicle, and a domineering mother who, in spite of living in a nursing home, is never far from the telephone or Jimmy. His crippling shyness renders him incapable of even saying hello to Peggy, the woman who works at an adjacent desk. When the father he has never known sends him an invitation and a plane ticket, Jimmy feels compelled to fly out to meet him. Jimmy's trip is mirrored by the boyhood tale of his grandfather, James, whose relationship with his father is tainted by unhappiness. Young James's mother has died, leaving his father with the unwanted job of bringing up the little boy alone, while at the same time maintaining his job as a glazier at the 1892 Chicago World's Fair. James is a frightened little boy, cowed by his father and bullied at school; he has a vagueness and fragility common to young, lonely and fearful children, qualities that are inherited generations later by his grandson. Chris Ware's illustrations are simply awe-inspiring in the true sense of the word. It is hard to believe that someone could put so much detail into each of the 380 pages that make up this incredible book, but there is a clue to his devotion in the afterword. After spending most of his life avoiding his own father, speaking only rarely on the phone, Ware finally met up with him: 'Gradually, the sublime outrageousness of our evening eroded into two people simply running out of things to say to each other. We weren't father and son anymore, just a pair of regretful men.'

Oppel also examines Benâs teenage angst over his own personal relationships, and the ethics of animal experimentation in this absorbing novel.

Jennifer Niven's deeply compelling and highly successful first teen novel All The Bright Places was very much for an older audience with its themes of depression and suicide. Her new book Holding Up the Universe is suitable for younger teens as well - and just as powerfully written. The book is narrated in turns by Libby, famous for once being 'America's Fattest Teen' and starting high school after years of being home schooled, and Jack, who seems to be one of the popular kids but secretly suffers from Prospagnosia - the inability to recognise the faces of familiar people even those in this own family which is often called 'face blindness'. Their worlds collide in a horribly cruel high school game and an unlikely friendship is formed that leads to something even deeper. Jennifer Niven is a gorgeous writer. Her characters Libby and Jack feel so real that it's almost impossible to believe they don't live and breathe. The author herself struggled with weight issues and anxiety over the years, particularly as a teenager, so this writing comes from the heart. The spotlight on prosopagnosia sheds an interesting light on a little known but not so uncommon condition. The ultimate message is uplifting and positive and one that teenagers everywhere need to hear: be yourself and you deserve to be wanted and loved for who you are.Â

The comic-strip adventures of Calvin, a naughty boy with a philosophical bent, and his soft toy tiger companion Hobbes, delighted readers from 1985 to 1995. The huge achievement of the comic's creator Bill Watterson is celebrated here in this wonderful cloth-bound three-volume box set, which contains in chronological order every Calvin and Hobbes strip. For those who have never experienced the sheer delight of Watterson's creation, here is a brief summary: Calvin is an active and imaginative little boy; his friend Hobbes appears as a stuffed tiger when other people are around, but when the two of them are alone he comes to life and is Calvin's friend and playmate. They live with Calvin's long-suffering parents, who have to cope with his turbulent behaviour. The charm of the strip is multi-faceted. On the one hand, Calvin is a typical six-year-old with a vivid imagination: one minute he is fearless intergalactic traveller Spaceman Spiff, crash-landing on a hostile planet, the next he is a fearsome T-Rex stalking his victim through the Jurassic jungle. He is in thrall to consumerism, hates school, loves making gruesome snowmen, and plays Calvinball, an anarchic game of ever-changing rules. Yet he is also given to philosophising about the big issues of life, ably supported or gently undermined by Hobbes's quietly caustic asides . Here is an outlet for Watterson's deeply-held views about the craziness of the modern world; indeed, the artist himself has always shunned publicity. The strip is also enhanced by its strong cast of supporting characters. Mrs Wormwood the teacher looms over Calvin when he not paying attention; the school bully is always on hand to 'pound' him; Susie, the little girl from down the road, often gets her own back on her snowball-throwing nemesis. Calvin's dad is a particularly funny creation: long-suffering, anti-media, and a proponent of fresh air, he also manages to get his revenge on his manic son by tying him up in mental knots with spurious bits of information . All these ingredients would, in the right hands, combine to make a perfectly good comic strip, but what always put Calvin and Hobbes ahead of the competition was the sheer artistry of Watterson's illustrations. In this regard, the chronological arrangement of the strips usefully shows Watterson's increasingly sophisticated technique, from his drawings of desert canyons and hideous inhabitants of alien planets, to the facial expressions of all his characters. It is hard to deny that Watterson owes a debt to Charles Schulz, whose Peanuts strip also offered a sophisticated yet deceptively simple evocation of the inner lives of children. For Calvin and Hobbes, however, Watterson combined uncanny ability, more than a touch of surrealism and a huge dose of humour to distil the essence of late-twentieth-century childhood, thereby elevating his strip into a league of its own.

On the eve of battle, Sir Thomas Lemuel Hawke of Cornwall writes a letter to his children. It is a guide on how to live well, like a knight: staying wise, humble, courageous, loving and kind.

This extraordinary graphic novel is so obviously a labour of love that the reader can only marvel at the energy that has been expended in its creation. Although the two plots that make up the book are essentially simple, the care with which Ware has executed them gives them an almost mythic quality. Jimmy Corrigan is a lonely, single, thirty-something with a boring job in an office cubicle, and a domineering mother who, in spite of living in a nursing home, is never far from the telephone or Jimmy. His crippling shyness renders him incapable of even saying hello to Peggy, the woman who works at an adjacent desk. When the father he has never known sends him an invitation and a plane ticket, Jimmy feels compelled to fly out to meet him. Jimmy's trip is mirrored by the boyhood tale of his grandfather, James, whose relationship with his father is tainted by unhappiness. Young James's mother has died, leaving his father with the unwanted job of bringing up the little boy alone, while at the same time maintaining his job as a glazier at the 1892 Chicago World's Fair. James is a frightened little boy, cowed by his father and bullied at school; he has a vagueness and fragility common to young, lonely and fearful children, qualities that are inherited generations later by his grandson. Chris Ware's illustrations are simply awe-inspiring in the true sense of the word. It is hard to believe that someone could put so much detail into each of the 380 pages that make up this incredible book, but there is a clue to his devotion in the afterword. After spending most of his life avoiding his own father, speaking only rarely on the phone, Ware finally met up with him: 'Gradually, the sublime outrageousness of our evening eroded into two people simply running out of things to say to each other. We weren't father and son anymore, just a pair of regretful men.'

Oppel bases his first YA novel on projects in the 1970s which tested the capability of chimpanzees to acquire sign language.

Readers are drawn into the tension between the emotional bond which Ben and his mother form with Zan, the demands of the research which dominate the attitude of Ben's more inhibited father, and the increasingly fraught relationship he has with his wife and son. Oppel also examines Benâs teenage angst over his own personal relationships, and the ethics of animal experimentation in this absorbing novel.

Jennifer Niven's deeply compelling and highly successful first teen novel All The Bright Places was very much for an older audience with its themes of depression and suicide. Her new book Holding Up the Universe is suitable for younger teens as well - and just as powerfully written. The book is narrated in turns by Libby, famous for once being 'America's Fattest Teen' and starting high school after years of being home schooled, and Jack, who seems to be one of the popular kids but secretly suffers from Prospagnosia - the inability to recognise the faces of familiar people even those in this own family which is often called 'face blindness'. Their worlds collide in a horribly cruel high school game and an unlikely friendship is formed that leads to something even deeper. Jennifer Niven is a gorgeous writer. Her characters Libby and Jack feel so real that it's almost impossible to believe they don't live and breathe. The author herself struggled with weight issues and anxiety over the years, particularly as a teenager, so this writing comes from the heart. The spotlight on prosopagnosia sheds an interesting light on a little known but not so uncommon condition. The ultimate message is uplifting and positive and one that teenagers everywhere need to hear: be yourself and you deserve to be wanted and loved for who you are.Â

The comic-strip adventures of Calvin, a naughty boy with a philosophical bent, and his soft toy tiger companion Hobbes, delighted readers from 1985 to 1995. The huge achievement of the comic's creator Bill Watterson is celebrated here in this wonderful cloth-bound three-volume box set, which contains in chronological order every Calvin and Hobbes strip. For those who have never experienced the sheer delight of Watterson's creation, here is a brief summary: Calvin is an active and imaginative little boy; his friend Hobbes appears as a stuffed tiger when other people are around, but when the two of them are alone he comes to life and is Calvin's friend and playmate. They live with Calvin's long-suffering parents, who have to cope with his turbulent behaviour. The charm of the strip is multi-faceted. On the one hand, Calvin is a typical six-year-old with a vivid imagination: one minute he is fearless intergalactic traveller Spaceman Spiff, crash-landing on a hostile planet, the next he is a fearsome T-Rex stalking his victim through the Jurassic jungle. He is in thrall to consumerism, hates school, loves making gruesome snowmen, and plays Calvinball, an anarchic game of ever-changing rules. Yet he is also given to philosophising about the big issues of life, ably supported or gently undermined by Hobbes's quietly caustic asides . Here is an outlet for Watterson's deeply-held views about the craziness of the modern world; indeed, the artist himself has always shunned publicity. The strip is also enhanced by its strong cast of supporting characters. Mrs Wormwood the teacher looms over Calvin when he not paying attention; the school bully is always on hand to 'pound' him; Susie, the little girl from down the road, often gets her own back on her snowball-throwing nemesis. Calvin's dad is a particularly funny creation: long-suffering, anti-media, and a proponent of fresh air, he also manages to get his revenge on his manic son by tying him up in mental knots with spurious bits of information . All these ingredients would, in the right hands, combine to make a perfectly good comic strip, but what always put Calvin and Hobbes ahead of the competition was the sheer artistry of Watterson's illustrations. In this regard, the chronological arrangement of the strips usefully shows Watterson's increasingly sophisticated technique, from his drawings of desert canyons and hideous inhabitants of alien planets, to the facial expressions of all his characters. It is hard to deny that Watterson owes a debt to Charles Schulz, whose Peanuts strip also offered a sophisticated yet deceptively simple evocation of the inner lives of children. For Calvin and Hobbes, however, Watterson combined uncanny ability, more than a touch of surrealism and a huge dose of humour to distil the essence of late-twentieth-century childhood, thereby elevating his strip into a league of its own.

On the eve of battle, Sir Thomas Lemuel Hawke of Cornwall writes a letter to his children. It is a guide on how to live well, like a knight: staying wise, humble, courageous, loving and kind.

This extraordinary graphic novel is so obviously a labour of love that the reader can only marvel at the energy that has been expended in its creation. Although the two plots that make up the book are essentially simple, the care with which Ware has executed them gives them an almost mythic quality. Jimmy Corrigan is a lonely, single, thirty-something with a boring job in an office cubicle, and a domineering mother who, in spite of living in a nursing home, is never far from the telephone or Jimmy. His crippling shyness renders him incapable of even saying hello to Peggy, the woman who works at an adjacent desk. When the father he has never known sends him an invitation and a plane ticket, Jimmy feels compelled to fly out to meet him. Jimmy's trip is mirrored by the boyhood tale of his grandfather, James, whose relationship with his father is tainted by unhappiness. Young James's mother has died, leaving his father with the unwanted job of bringing up the little boy alone, while at the same time maintaining his job as a glazier at the 1892 Chicago World's Fair. James is a frightened little boy, cowed by his father and bullied at school; he has a vagueness and fragility common to young, lonely and fearful children, qualities that are inherited generations later by his grandson. Chris Ware's illustrations are simply awe-inspiring in the true sense of the word. It is hard to believe that someone could put so much detail into each of the 380 pages that make up this incredible book, but there is a clue to his devotion in the afterword. After spending most of his life avoiding his own father, speaking only rarely on the phone, Ware finally met up with him: 'Gradually, the sublime outrageousness of our evening eroded into two people simply running out of things to say to each other. We weren't father and son anymore, just a pair of regretful men.'

Oppel bases his first YA novel on projects in the 1970s which tested the capability of chimpanzees to acquire sign language. His setting, facts, and outcomes closely mirror events then, and we meet thirteen-year old Ben, an only child whose researcher parents adopt a neonate chimp, Zan, and rear him as part of the family. Readers are drawn into the tension between the emotional bond which Ben and his mother form with Zan, the demands of the research which dominate the attitude of Ben's more inhibited father, and the increasingly fraught relationship he has with his wife and son. Oppel also examines Benâs teenage angst over his own personal relationships, and the ethics of animal experimentation in this absorbing novel.

Jennifer Niven's deeply compelling and highly successful first teen novel All The Bright Places was very much for an older audience with its themes of depression and suicide. Her new book Holding Up the Universe is suitable for younger teens as well - and just as powerfully written. The book is narrated in turns by Libby, famous for once being 'America's Fattest Teen' and starting high school after years of being home schooled, and Jack, who seems to be one of the popular kids but secretly suffers from Prospagnosia - the inability to recognise the faces of familiar people even those in this own family which is often called 'face blindness'. Their worlds collide in a horribly cruel high school game and an unlikely friendship is formed that leads to something even deeper. Jennifer Niven is a gorgeous writer. Her characters Libby and Jack feel so real that it's almost impossible to believe they don't live and breathe. The author herself struggled with weight issues and anxiety over the years, particularly as a teenager, so this writing comes from the heart. The spotlight on prosopagnosia sheds an interesting light on a little known but not so uncommon condition. The ultimate message is uplifting and positive and one that teenagers everywhere need to hear: be yourself and you deserve to be wanted and loved for who you are.Â

The comic-strip adventures of Calvin, a naughty boy with a philosophical bent, and his soft toy tiger companion Hobbes, delighted readers from 1985 to 1995. The huge achievement of the comic's creator Bill Watterson is celebrated here in this wonderful cloth-bound three-volume box set, which contains in chronological order every Calvin and Hobbes strip. For those who have never experienced the sheer delight of Watterson's creation, here is a brief summary: Calvin is an active and imaginative little boy; his friend Hobbes appears as a stuffed tiger when other people are around, but when the two of them are alone he comes to life and is Calvin's friend and playmate. They live with Calvin's long-suffering parents, who have to cope with his turbulent behaviour. The charm of the strip is multi-faceted. On the one hand, Calvin is a typical six-year-old with a vivid imagination: one minute he is fearless intergalactic traveller Spaceman Spiff, crash-landing on a hostile planet, the next he is a fearsome T-Rex stalking his victim through the Jurassic jungle. He is in thrall to consumerism, hates school, loves making gruesome snowmen, and plays Calvinball, an anarchic game of ever-changing rules. Yet he is also given to philosophising about the big issues of life, ably supported or gently undermined by Hobbes's quietly caustic asides . Here is an outlet for Watterson's deeply-held views about the craziness of the modern world; indeed, the artist himself has always shunned publicity. The strip is also enhanced by its strong cast of supporting characters. Mrs Wormwood the teacher looms over Calvin when he not paying attention; the school bully is always on hand to 'pound' him; Susie, the little girl from down the road, often gets her own back on her snowball-throwing nemesis. Calvin's dad is a particularly funny creation: long-suffering, anti-media, and a proponent of fresh air, he also manages to get his revenge on his manic son by tying him up in mental knots with spurious bits of information . All these ingredients would, in the right hands, combine to make a perfectly good comic strip, but what always put Calvin and Hobbes ahead of the competition was the sheer artistry of Watterson's illustrations. In this regard, the chronological arrangement of the strips usefully shows Watterson's increasingly sophisticated technique, from his drawings of desert canyons and hideous inhabitants of alien planets, to the facial expressions of all his characters. It is hard to deny that Watterson owes a debt to Charles Schulz, whose Peanuts strip also offered a sophisticated yet deceptively simple evocation of the inner lives of children. For Calvin and Hobbes, however, Watterson combined uncanny ability, more than a touch of surrealism and a huge dose of humour to distil the essence of late-twentieth-century childhood, thereby elevating his strip into a league of its own.

On the eve of battle, Sir Thomas Lemuel Hawke of Cornwall writes a letter to his children. It is a guide on how to live well, like a knight: staying wise, humble, courageous, loving and kind.

Hawke has a way with a sentence, and many of the sections read like note-perfect proverbs. There are also some lovely, tender scenes with the grandfather.

This extraordinary graphic novel is so obviously a labour of love that the reader can only marvel at the energy that has been expended in its creation. Although the two plots that make up the book are essentially simple, the care with which Ware has executed them gives them an almost mythic quality. Jimmy Corrigan is a lonely, single, thirty-something with a boring job in an office cubicle, and a domineering mother who, in spite of living in a nursing home, is never far from the telephone or Jimmy. His crippling shyness renders him incapable of even saying hello to Peggy, the woman who works at an adjacent desk. When the father he has never known sends him an invitation and a plane ticket, Jimmy feels compelled to fly out to meet him. Jimmy's trip is mirrored by the boyhood tale of his grandfather, James, whose relationship with his father is tainted by unhappiness. Young James's mother has died, leaving his father with the unwanted job of bringing up the little boy alone, while at the same time maintaining his job as a glazier at the 1892 Chicago World's Fair. James is a frightened little boy, cowed by his father and bullied at school; he has a vagueness and fragility common to young, lonely and fearful children, qualities that are inherited generations later by his grandson. Chris Ware's illustrations are simply awe-inspiring in the true sense of the word. It is hard to believe that someone could put so much detail into each of the 380 pages that make up this incredible book, but there is a clue to his devotion in the afterword. After spending most of his life avoiding his own father, speaking only rarely on the phone, Ware finally met up with him: 'Gradually, the sublime outrageousness of our evening eroded into two people simply running out of things to say to each other. We weren't father and son anymore, just a pair of regretful men.'

Oppel bases his first YA novel on projects in the 1970s which tested the capability of chimpanzees to acquire sign language. His setting, facts, and outcomes closely mirror events then, and we meet thirteen-year old Ben, an only child whose researcher parents adopt a neonate chimp, Zan, and rear him as part of the family. Readers are drawn into the tension between the emotional bond which Ben and his mother form with Zan, the demands of the research which dominate the attitude of Ben's more inhibited father, and the increasingly fraught relationship he has with his wife and son. Oppel also examines Benâs teenage angst over his own personal relationships, and the ethics of animal experimentation in this absorbing novel.

Jennifer Niven's deeply compelling and highly successful first teen novel All The Bright Places was very much for an older audience with its themes of depression and suicide. Her new book Holding Up the Universe is suitable for younger teens as well - and just as powerfully written. The book is narrated in turns by Libby, famous for once being 'America's Fattest Teen' and starting high school after years of being home schooled, and Jack, who seems to be one of the popular kids but secretly suffers from Prospagnosia - the inability to recognise the faces of familiar people even those in this own family which is often called 'face blindness'. Their worlds collide in a horribly cruel high school game and an unlikely friendship is formed that leads to something even deeper. Jennifer Niven is a gorgeous writer. Her characters Libby and Jack feel so real that it's almost impossible to believe they don't live and breathe. The author herself struggled with weight issues and anxiety over the years, particularly as a teenager, so this writing comes from the heart. The spotlight on prosopagnosia sheds an interesting light on a little known but not so uncommon condition. The ultimate message is uplifting and positive and one that teenagers everywhere need to hear: be yourself and you deserve to be wanted and loved for who you are.Â

The comic-strip adventures of Calvin, a naughty boy with a philosophical bent, and his soft toy tiger companion Hobbes, delighted readers from 1985 to 1995. The huge achievement of the comic's creator Bill Watterson is celebrated here in this wonderful cloth-bound three-volume box set, which contains in chronological order every Calvin and Hobbes strip. For those who have never experienced the sheer delight of Watterson's creation, here is a brief summary: Calvin is an active and imaginative little boy; his friend Hobbes appears as a stuffed tiger when other people are around, but when the two of them are alone he comes to life and is Calvin's friend and playmate. They live with Calvin's long-suffering parents, who have to cope with his turbulent behaviour. The charm of the strip is multi-faceted. On the one hand, Calvin is a typical six-year-old with a vivid imagination: one minute he is fearless intergalactic traveller Spaceman Spiff, crash-landing on a hostile planet, the next he is a fearsome T-Rex stalking his victim through the Jurassic jungle. He is in thrall to consumerism, hates school, loves making gruesome snowmen, and plays Calvinball, an anarchic game of ever-changing rules. Yet he is also given to philosophising about the big issues of life, ably supported or gently undermined by Hobbes's quietly caustic asides . Here is an outlet for Watterson's deeply-held views about the craziness of the modern world; indeed, the artist himself has always shunned publicity. The strip is also enhanced by its strong cast of supporting characters. Mrs Wormwood the teacher looms over Calvin when he not paying attention; the school bully is always on hand to 'pound' him; Susie, the little girl from down the road, often gets her own back on her snowball-throwing nemesis. Calvin's dad is a particularly funny creation: long-suffering, anti-media, and a proponent of fresh air, he also manages to get his revenge on his manic son by tying him up in mental knots with spurious bits of information . All these ingredients would, in the right hands, combine to make a perfectly good comic strip, but what always put Calvin and Hobbes ahead of the competition was the sheer artistry of Watterson's illustrations. In this regard, the chronological arrangement of the strips usefully shows Watterson's increasingly sophisticated technique, from his drawings of desert canyons and hideous inhabitants of alien planets, to the facial expressions of all his characters. It is hard to deny that Watterson owes a debt to Charles Schulz, whose Peanuts strip also offered a sophisticated yet deceptively simple evocation of the inner lives of children. For Calvin and Hobbes, however, Watterson combined uncanny ability, more than a touch of surrealism and a huge dose of humour to distil the essence of late-twentieth-century childhood, thereby elevating his strip into a league of its own.

On the eve of battle, Sir Thomas Lemuel Hawke of Cornwall writes a letter to his children. It is a guide on how to live well, like a knight: staying wise, humble, courageous, loving and kind.

This extraordinary graphic novel is so obviously a labour of love that the reader can only marvel at the energy that has been expended in its creation. Although the two plots that make up the book are essentially simple, the care with which Ware has executed them gives them an almost mythic quality. Jimmy Corrigan is a lonely, single, thirty-something with a boring job in an office cubicle, and a domineering mother who, in spite of living in a nursing home, is never far from the telephone or Jimmy. His crippling shyness renders him incapable of even saying hello to Peggy, the woman who works at an adjacent desk. When the father he has never known sends him an invitation and a plane ticket, Jimmy feels compelled to fly out to meet him. Jimmy's trip is mirrored by the boyhood tale of his grandfather, James, whose relationship with his father is tainted by unhappiness. Young James's mother has died, leaving his father with the unwanted job of bringing up the little boy alone, while at the same time maintaining his job as a glazier at the 1892 Chicago World's Fair. James is a frightened little boy, cowed by his father and bullied at school; he has a vagueness and fragility common to young, lonely and fearful children, qualities that are inherited generations later by his grandson. Chris Ware's illustrations are simply awe-inspiring in the true sense of the word. It is hard to believe that someone could put so much detail into each of the 380 pages that make up this incredible book, but there is a clue to his devotion in the afterword. After spending most of his life avoiding his own father, speaking only rarely on the phone, Ware finally met up with him: 'Gradually, the sublime outrageousness of our evening eroded into two people simply running out of things to say to each other. We weren't father and son anymore, just a pair of regretful men.'

A sometimes sad and sometimes wry tale of bullying and fitting in, The Song From Somewhere Else is also a magical tale about how - sometimes - people might feel alien to us, but that families are universal, whoever you are. Levi Pinfold's stunning, intricate and moody illustrations add an extra layer of atmosphere to this heartfelt and beautifully strange story. Winner of the Kate Greenaway Amnesty CLIP Honour in 2018.

Suzy Smith is very surprised when a huge magical train takes a shortcut through her downstairs hallway one evening. Staffed by trolls, the Impossible Postal Express delivers letters and parcels across a series of magical worlds connected to our own: the Union of Impossible Places. Her curiosity getting the better of her, Suzy hitches a ride and becomes the newest postie. But when her first delivery goes disastrously wrong, she's not only caught up in an amazing magical adventure, but the fate of the Union itself rests on her shoulders... Two towers locked in a power struggle, a cursed boy trapped in a snowglobe, warrior statues, wormholes and negotiable gravity are just a few things Suzy encounters on her incredible journey. Knowledge is power in the Impossible Places, but who is telling the whole truth?

Oppel bases his first YA novel on projects in the 1970s which tested the capability of chimpanzees to acquire sign language. His setting, facts, and outcomes closely mirror events then, and we meet thirteen-year old Ben, an only child whose researcher parents adopt a neonate chimp, Zan, and rear him as part of the family. Readers are drawn into the tension between the emotional bond which Ben and his mother form with Zan, the demands of the research which dominate the attitude of Ben's more inhibited father, and the increasingly fraught relationship he has with his wife and son. Oppel also examines Benâs teenage angst over his own personal relationships, and the ethics of animal experimentation in this absorbing novel.

Jennifer Niven's deeply compelling and highly successful first teen novel All The Bright Places was very much for an older audience with its themes of depression and suicide. Her new book Holding Up the Universe is suitable for younger teens as well - and just as powerfully written. The book is narrated in turns by Libby, famous for once being 'America's Fattest Teen' and starting high school after years of being home schooled, and Jack, who seems to be one of the popular kids but secretly suffers from Prospagnosia - the inability to recognise the faces of familiar people even those in this own family which is often called 'face blindness'. Their worlds collide in a horribly cruel high school game and an unlikely friendship is formed that leads to something even deeper. Jennifer Niven is a gorgeous writer. Her characters Libby and Jack feel so real that it's almost impossible to believe they don't live and breathe. The author herself struggled with weight issues and anxiety over the years, particularly as a teenager, so this writing comes from the heart. The spotlight on prosopagnosia sheds an interesting light on a little known but not so uncommon condition. The ultimate message is uplifting and positive and one that teenagers everywhere need to hear: be yourself and you deserve to be wanted and loved for who you are.Â

The comic-strip adventures of Calvin, a naughty boy with a philosophical bent, and his soft toy tiger companion Hobbes, delighted readers from 1985 to 1995. The huge achievement of the comic's creator Bill Watterson is celebrated here in this wonderful cloth-bound three-volume box set, which contains in chronological order every Calvin and Hobbes strip. For those who have never experienced the sheer delight of Watterson's creation, here is a brief summary: Calvin is an active and imaginative little boy; his friend Hobbes appears as a stuffed tiger when other people are around, but when the two of them are alone he comes to life and is Calvin's friend and playmate. They live with Calvin's long-suffering parents, who have to cope with his turbulent behaviour. The charm of the strip is multi-faceted. On the one hand, Calvin is a typical six-year-old with a vivid imagination: one minute he is fearless intergalactic traveller Spaceman Spiff, crash-landing on a hostile planet, the next he is a fearsome T-Rex stalking his victim through the Jurassic jungle. He is in thrall to consumerism, hates school, loves making gruesome snowmen, and plays Calvinball, an anarchic game of ever-changing rules. Yet he is also given to philosophising about the big issues of life, ably supported or gently undermined by Hobbes's quietly caustic asides . Here is an outlet for Watterson's deeply-held views about the craziness of the modern world; indeed, the artist himself has always shunned publicity. The strip is also enhanced by its strong cast of supporting characters. Mrs Wormwood the teacher looms over Calvin when he not paying attention; the school bully is always on hand to 'pound' him; Susie, the little girl from down the road, often gets her own back on her snowball-throwing nemesis. Calvin's dad is a particularly funny creation: long-suffering, anti-media, and a proponent of fresh air, he also manages to get his revenge on his manic son by tying him up in mental knots with spurious bits of information . All these ingredients would, in the right hands, combine to make a perfectly good comic strip, but what always put Calvin and Hobbes ahead of the competition was the sheer artistry of Watterson's illustrations. In this regard, the chronological arrangement of the strips usefully shows Watterson's increasingly sophisticated technique, from his drawings of desert canyons and hideous inhabitants of alien planets, to the facial expressions of all his characters. It is hard to deny that Watterson owes a debt to Charles Schulz, whose Peanuts strip also offered a sophisticated yet deceptively simple evocation of the inner lives of children. For Calvin and Hobbes, however, Watterson combined uncanny ability, more than a touch of surrealism and a huge dose of humour to distil the essence of late-twentieth-century childhood, thereby elevating his strip into a league of its own.

On the eve of battle, Sir Thomas Lemuel Hawke of Cornwall writes a letter to his children. It is a guide on how to live well, like a knight: staying wise, humble, courageous, loving and kind.

Inside, an editorâs note talks about the discovery of the âhistoricalâ letter, confirming Sir Thomas's death at the Battle of Slaughter Bridge in 1483.It all gives the book an important and timeless feel. Hawke has a way with a sentence, and many of the sections read like note-perfect proverbs. There are also some lovely, tender scenes with the grandfather.

This extraordinary graphic novel is so obviously a labour of love that the reader can only marvel at the energy that has been expended in its creation. Although the two plots that make up the book are essentially simple, the care with which Ware has executed them gives them an almost mythic quality. Jimmy Corrigan is a lonely, single, thirty-something with a boring job in an office cubicle, and a domineering mother who, in spite of living in a nursing home, is never far from the telephone or Jimmy. His crippling shyness renders him incapable of even saying hello to Peggy, the woman who works at an adjacent desk. When the father he has never known sends him an invitation and a plane ticket, Jimmy feels compelled to fly out to meet him. Jimmy's trip is mirrored by the boyhood tale of his grandfather, James, whose relationship with his father is tainted by unhappiness. Young James's mother has died, leaving his father with the unwanted job of bringing up the little boy alone, while at the same time maintaining his job as a glazier at the 1892 Chicago World's Fair. James is a frightened little boy, cowed by his father and bullied at school; he has a vagueness and fragility common to young, lonely and fearful children, qualities that are inherited generations later by his grandson. Chris Ware's illustrations are simply awe-inspiring in the true sense of the word. It is hard to believe that someone could put so much detail into each of the 380 pages that make up this incredible book, but there is a clue to his devotion in the afterword. After spending most of his life avoiding his own father, speaking only rarely on the phone, Ware finally met up with him: 'Gradually, the sublime outrageousness of our evening eroded into two people simply running out of things to say to each other. We weren't father and son anymore, just a pair of regretful men.'

Suzy Smith is very surprised when a huge magical train takes a shortcut through her downstairs hallway one evening. Staffed by trolls, the Impossible Postal Express delivers letters and parcels across a series of magical worlds connected to our own: the Union of Impossible Places. Her curiosity getting the better of her, Suzy hitches a ride and becomes the newest postie. But when her first delivery goes disastrously wrong, she's not only caught up in an amazing magical adventure, but the fate of the Union itself rests on her shoulders... Two towers locked in a power struggle, a cursed boy trapped in a snowglobe, warrior statues, wormholes and negotiable gravity are just a few things Suzy encounters on her incredible journey. Knowledge is power in the Impossible Places, but who is telling the whole truth? Suzy has a brilliant scientific mind, but isn't really one for thinking about consequences â she tends more towards jumping now and thinking later, though her heart is definitely in the right place.

Oppel bases his first YA novel on projects in the 1970s which tested the capability of chimpanzees to acquire sign language. His setting, facts, and outcomes closely mirror events then, and we meet thirteen-year old Ben, an only child whose researcher parents adopt a neonate chimp, Zan, and rear him as part of the family. Readers are drawn into the tension between the emotional bond which Ben and his mother form with Zan, the demands of the research which dominate the attitude of Ben's more inhibited father, and the increasingly fraught relationship he has with his wife and son. Oppel also examines Benâs teenage angst over his own personal relationships, and the ethics of animal experimentation in this absorbing novel.

Jennifer Niven's deeply compelling and highly successful first teen novel All The Bright Places was very much for an older audience with its themes of depression and suicide. Her new book Holding Up the Universe is suitable for younger teens as well - and just as powerfully written. The book is narrated in turns by Libby, famous for once being 'America's Fattest Teen' and starting high school after years of being home schooled, and Jack, who seems to be one of the popular kids but secretly suffers from Prospagnosia - the inability to recognise the faces of familiar people even those in this own family which is often called 'face blindness'. Their worlds collide in a horribly cruel high school game and an unlikely friendship is formed that leads to something even deeper. Jennifer Niven is a gorgeous writer. Her characters Libby and Jack feel so real that it's almost impossible to believe they don't live and breathe. The author herself struggled with weight issues and anxiety over the years, particularly as a teenager, so this writing comes from the heart. The spotlight on prosopagnosia sheds an interesting light on a little known but not so uncommon condition. The ultimate message is uplifting and positive and one that teenagers everywhere need to hear: be yourself and you deserve to be wanted and loved for who you are.Â

The comic-strip adventures of Calvin, a naughty boy with a philosophical bent, and his soft toy tiger companion Hobbes, delighted readers from 1985 to 1995. The huge achievement of the comic's creator Bill Watterson is celebrated here in this wonderful cloth-bound three-volume box set, which contains in chronological order every Calvin and Hobbes strip. For those who have never experienced the sheer delight of Watterson's creation, here is a brief summary: Calvin is an active and imaginative little boy; his friend Hobbes appears as a stuffed tiger when other people are around, but when the two of them are alone he comes to life and is Calvin's friend and playmate. They live with Calvin's long-suffering parents, who have to cope with his turbulent behaviour. The charm of the strip is multi-faceted. On the one hand, Calvin is a typical six-year-old with a vivid imagination: one minute he is fearless intergalactic traveller Spaceman Spiff, crash-landing on a hostile planet, the next he is a fearsome T-Rex stalking his victim through the Jurassic jungle. He is in thrall to consumerism, hates school, loves making gruesome snowmen, and plays Calvinball, an anarchic game of ever-changing rules. Yet he is also given to philosophising about the big issues of life, ably supported or gently undermined by Hobbes's quietly caustic asides . Here is an outlet for Watterson's deeply-held views about the craziness of the modern world; indeed, the artist himself has always shunned publicity. The strip is also enhanced by its strong cast of supporting characters. Mrs Wormwood the teacher looms over Calvin when he not paying attention; the school bully is always on hand to 'pound' him; Susie, the little girl from down the road, often gets her own back on her snowball-throwing nemesis. Calvin's dad is a particularly funny creation: long-suffering, anti-media, and a proponent of fresh air, he also manages to get his revenge on his manic son by tying him up in mental knots with spurious bits of information . All these ingredients would, in the right hands, combine to make a perfectly good comic strip, but what always put Calvin and Hobbes ahead of the competition was the sheer artistry of Watterson's illustrations. In this regard, the chronological arrangement of the strips usefully shows Watterson's increasingly sophisticated technique, from his drawings of desert canyons and hideous inhabitants of alien planets, to the facial expressions of all his characters. It is hard to deny that Watterson owes a debt to Charles Schulz, whose Peanuts strip also offered a sophisticated yet deceptively simple evocation of the inner lives of children. For Calvin and Hobbes, however, Watterson combined uncanny ability, more than a touch of surrealism and a huge dose of humour to distil the essence of late-twentieth-century childhood, thereby elevating his strip into a league of its own.

This extraordinary graphic novel is so obviously a labour of love that the reader can only marvel at the energy that has been expended in its creation. Although the two plots that make up the book are essentially simple, the care with which Ware has executed them gives them an almost mythic quality. Jimmy Corrigan is a lonely, single, thirty-something with a boring job in an office cubicle, and a domineering mother who, in spite of living in a nursing home, is never far from the telephone or Jimmy. His crippling shyness renders him incapable of even saying hello to Peggy, the woman who works at an adjacent desk. When the father he has never known sends him an invitation and a plane ticket, Jimmy feels compelled to fly out to meet him. Jimmy's trip is mirrored by the boyhood tale of his grandfather, James, whose relationship with his father is tainted by unhappiness. Young James's mother has died, leaving his father with the unwanted job of bringing up the little boy alone, while at the same time maintaining his job as a glazier at the 1892 Chicago World's Fair. James is a frightened little boy, cowed by his father and bullied at school; he has a vagueness and fragility common to young, lonely and fearful children, qualities that are inherited generations later by his grandson. Chris Ware's illustrations are simply awe-inspiring in the true sense of the word. It is hard to believe that someone could put so much detail into each of the 380 pages that make up this incredible book, but there is a clue to his devotion in the afterword. After spending most of his life avoiding his own father, speaking only rarely on the phone, Ware finally met up with him: 'Gradually, the sublime outrageousness of our evening eroded into two people simply running out of things to say to each other. We weren't father and son anymore, just a pair of regretful men.'

Suzy Smith is very surprised when a huge magical train takes a shortcut through her downstairs hallway one evening. Staffed by trolls, the Impossible Postal Express delivers letters and parcels across a series of magical worlds connected to our own: the Union of Impossible Places. Her curiosity getting the better of her, Suzy hitches a ride and becomes the newest postie. But when her first delivery goes disastrously wrong, she's not only caught up in an amazing magical adventure, but the fate of the Union itself rests on her shoulders... Two towers locked in a power struggle, a cursed boy trapped in a snowglobe, warrior statues, wormholes and negotiable gravity are just a few things Suzy encounters on her incredible journey. Knowledge is power in the Impossible Places, but who is telling the whole truth? Suzy has a brilliant scientific mind, but isn't really one for thinking about consequences â she tends more towards jumping now and thinking later, though her heart is definitely in the right place. This roller-coaster of a book is pacey, fun, and full of lots of fantastical new ideas.

Oppel bases his first YA novel on projects in the 1970s which tested the capability of chimpanzees to acquire sign language. His setting, facts, and outcomes closely mirror events then, and we meet thirteen-year old Ben, an only child whose researcher parents adopt a neonate chimp, Zan, and rear him as part of the family. Readers are drawn into the tension between the emotional bond which Ben and his mother form with Zan, the demands of the research which dominate the attitude of Ben's more inhibited father, and the increasingly fraught relationship he has with his wife and son. Oppel also examines Benâs teenage angst over his own personal relationships, and the ethics of animal experimentation in this absorbing novel.

Jennifer Niven's deeply compelling and highly successful first teen novel All The Bright Places was very much for an older audience with its themes of depression and suicide. Her new book Holding Up the Universe is suitable for younger teens as well - and just as powerfully written. The book is narrated in turns by Libby, famous for once being 'America's Fattest Teen' and starting high school after years of being home schooled, and Jack, who seems to be one of the popular kids but secretly suffers from Prospagnosia - the inability to recognise the faces of familiar people even those in this own family which is often called 'face blindness'. Their worlds collide in a horribly cruel high school game and an unlikely friendship is formed that leads to something even deeper. Jennifer Niven is a gorgeous writer. Her characters Libby and Jack feel so real that it's almost impossible to believe they don't live and breathe. The author herself struggled with weight issues and anxiety over the years, particularly as a teenager, so this writing comes from the heart. The spotlight on prosopagnosia sheds an interesting light on a little known but not so uncommon condition. The ultimate message is uplifting and positive and one that teenagers everywhere need to hear: be yourself and you deserve to be wanted and loved for who you are.Â

The comic-strip adventures of Calvin, a naughty boy with a philosophical bent, and his soft toy tiger companion Hobbes, delighted readers from 1985 to 1995. The huge achievement of the comic's creator Bill Watterson is celebrated here in this wonderful cloth-bound three-volume box set, which contains in chronological order every Calvin and Hobbes strip. For those who have never experienced the sheer delight of Watterson's creation, here is a brief summary: Calvin is an active and imaginative little boy; his friend Hobbes appears as a stuffed tiger when other people are around, but when the two of them are alone he comes to life and is Calvin's friend and playmate. They live with Calvin's long-suffering parents, who have to cope with his turbulent behaviour. The charm of the strip is multi-faceted. On the one hand, Calvin is a typical six-year-old with a vivid imagination: one minute he is fearless intergalactic traveller Spaceman Spiff, crash-landing on a hostile planet, the next he is a fearsome T-Rex stalking his victim through the Jurassic jungle. He is in thrall to consumerism, hates school, loves making gruesome snowmen, and plays Calvinball, an anarchic game of ever-changing rules. Yet he is also given to philosophising about the big issues of life, ably supported or gently undermined by Hobbes's quietly caustic asides . Here is an outlet for Watterson's deeply-held views about the craziness of the modern world; indeed, the artist himself has always shunned publicity. The strip is also enhanced by its strong cast of supporting characters. Mrs Wormwood the teacher looms over Calvin when he not paying attention; the school bully is always on hand to 'pound' him; Susie, the little girl from down the road, often gets her own back on her snowball-throwing nemesis. Calvin's dad is a particularly funny creation: long-suffering, anti-media, and a proponent of fresh air, he also manages to get his revenge on his manic son by tying him up in mental knots with spurious bits of information . All these ingredients would, in the right hands, combine to make a perfectly good comic strip, but what always put Calvin and Hobbes ahead of the competition was the sheer artistry of Watterson's illustrations. In this regard, the chronological arrangement of the strips usefully shows Watterson's increasingly sophisticated technique, from his drawings of desert canyons and hideous inhabitants of alien planets, to the facial expressions of all his characters. It is hard to deny that Watterson owes a debt to Charles Schulz, whose Peanuts strip also offered a sophisticated yet deceptively simple evocation of the inner lives of children. For Calvin and Hobbes, however, Watterson combined uncanny ability, more than a touch of surrealism and a huge dose of humour to distil the essence of late-twentieth-century childhood, thereby elevating his strip into a league of its own.

This extraordinary graphic novel is so obviously a labour of love that the reader can only marvel at the energy that has been expended in its creation. Although the two plots that make up the book are essentially simple, the care with which Ware has executed them gives them an almost mythic quality. Jimmy Corrigan is a lonely, single, thirty-something with a boring job in an office cubicle, and a domineering mother who, in spite of living in a nursing home, is never far from the telephone or Jimmy. His crippling shyness renders him incapable of even saying hello to Peggy, the woman who works at an adjacent desk. When the father he has never known sends him an invitation and a plane ticket, Jimmy feels compelled to fly out to meet him. Jimmy's trip is mirrored by the boyhood tale of his grandfather, James, whose relationship with his father is tainted by unhappiness. Young James's mother has died, leaving his father with the unwanted job of bringing up the little boy alone, while at the same time maintaining his job as a glazier at the 1892 Chicago World's Fair. James is a frightened little boy, cowed by his father and bullied at school; he has a vagueness and fragility common to young, lonely and fearful children, qualities that are inherited generations later by his grandson. Chris Ware's illustrations are simply awe-inspiring in the true sense of the word. It is hard to believe that someone could put so much detail into each of the 380 pages that make up this incredible book, but there is a clue to his devotion in the afterword. After spending most of his life avoiding his own father, speaking only rarely on the phone, Ware finally met up with him: 'Gradually, the sublime outrageousness of our evening eroded into two people simply running out of things to say to each other. We weren't father and son anymore, just a pair of regretful men.'

Two towers locked in a power struggle, a cursed boy trapped in a snowglobe, warrior statues, wormholes and negotiable gravity are just a few things Suzy encounters on her incredible journey. Knowledge is power in the Impossible Places, but who is telling the whole truth? Suzy has a brilliant scientific mind, but isn't really one for thinking about consequences â she tends more towards jumping now and thinking later, though her heart is definitely in the right place. This roller-coaster of a book is pacey, fun, and full of lots of fantastical new ideas.

Oppel bases his first YA novel on projects in the 1970s which tested the capability of chimpanzees to acquire sign language. His setting, facts, and outcomes closely mirror events then, and we meet thirteen-year old Ben, an only child whose researcher parents adopt a neonate chimp, Zan, and rear him as part of the family. Readers are drawn into the tension between the emotional bond which Ben and his mother form with Zan, the demands of the research which dominate the attitude of Ben's more inhibited father, and the increasingly fraught relationship he has with his wife and son. Oppel also examines Benâs teenage angst over his own personal relationships, and the ethics of animal experimentation in this absorbing novel.

Jennifer Niven's deeply compelling and highly successful first teen novel All The Bright Places was very much for an older audience with its themes of depression and suicide. Her new book Holding Up the Universe is suitable for younger teens as well - and just as powerfully written. The book is narrated in turns by Libby, famous for once being 'America's Fattest Teen' and starting high school after years of being home schooled, and Jack, who seems to be one of the popular kids but secretly suffers from Prospagnosia - the inability to recognise the faces of familiar people even those in this own family which is often called 'face blindness'. Their worlds collide in a horribly cruel high school game and an unlikely friendship is formed that leads to something even deeper. Jennifer Niven is a gorgeous writer. Her characters Libby and Jack feel so real that it's almost impossible to believe they don't live and breathe. The author herself struggled with weight issues and anxiety over the years, particularly as a teenager, so this writing comes from the heart. The spotlight on prosopagnosia sheds an interesting light on a little known but not so uncommon condition. The ultimate message is uplifting and positive and one that teenagers everywhere need to hear: be yourself and you deserve to be wanted and loved for who you are.Â

The comic-strip adventures of Calvin, a naughty boy with a philosophical bent, and his soft toy tiger companion Hobbes, delighted readers from 1985 to 1995. The huge achievement of the comic's creator Bill Watterson is celebrated here in this wonderful cloth-bound three-volume box set, which contains in chronological order every Calvin and Hobbes strip. For those who have never experienced the sheer delight of Watterson's creation, here is a brief summary: Calvin is an active and imaginative little boy; his friend Hobbes appears as a stuffed tiger when other people are around, but when the two of them are alone he comes to life and is Calvin's friend and playmate. They live with Calvin's long-suffering parents, who have to cope with his turbulent behaviour. The charm of the strip is multi-faceted. On the one hand, Calvin is a typical six-year-old with a vivid imagination: one minute he is fearless intergalactic traveller Spaceman Spiff, crash-landing on a hostile planet, the next he is a fearsome T-Rex stalking his victim through the Jurassic jungle. He is in thrall to consumerism, hates school, loves making gruesome snowmen, and plays Calvinball, an anarchic game of ever-changing rules. Yet he is also given to philosophising about the big issues of life, ably supported or gently undermined by Hobbes's quietly caustic asides . Here is an outlet for Watterson's deeply-held views about the craziness of the modern world; indeed, the artist himself has always shunned publicity. The strip is also enhanced by its strong cast of supporting characters. Mrs Wormwood the teacher looms over Calvin when he not paying attention; the school bully is always on hand to 'pound' him; Susie, the little girl from down the road, often gets her own back on her snowball-throwing nemesis. Calvin's dad is a particularly funny creation: long-suffering, anti-media, and a proponent of fresh air, he also manages to get his revenge on his manic son by tying him up in mental knots with spurious bits of information . All these ingredients would, in the right hands, combine to make a perfectly good comic strip, but what always put Calvin and Hobbes ahead of the competition was the sheer artistry of Watterson's illustrations. In this regard, the chronological arrangement of the strips usefully shows Watterson's increasingly sophisticated technique, from his drawings of desert canyons and hideous inhabitants of alien planets, to the facial expressions of all his characters. It is hard to deny that Watterson owes a debt to Charles Schulz, whose Peanuts strip also offered a sophisticated yet deceptively simple evocation of the inner lives of children. For Calvin and Hobbes, however, Watterson combined uncanny ability, more than a touch of surrealism and a huge dose of humour to distil the essence of late-twentieth-century childhood, thereby elevating his strip into a league of its own.

This extraordinary graphic novel is so obviously a labour of love that the reader can only marvel at the energy that has been expended in its creation. Although the two plots that make up the book are essentially simple, the care with which Ware has executed them gives them an almost mythic quality. Jimmy Corrigan is a lonely, single, thirty-something with a boring job in an office cubicle, and a domineering mother who, in spite of living in a nursing home, is never far from the telephone or Jimmy. His crippling shyness renders him incapable of even saying hello to Peggy, the woman who works at an adjacent desk. When the father he has never known sends him an invitation and a plane ticket, Jimmy feels compelled to fly out to meet him. Jimmy's trip is mirrored by the boyhood tale of his grandfather, James, whose relationship with his father is tainted by unhappiness. Young James's mother has died, leaving his father with the unwanted job of bringing up the little boy alone, while at the same time maintaining his job as a glazier at the 1892 Chicago World's Fair. James is a frightened little boy, cowed by his father and bullied at school; he has a vagueness and fragility common to young, lonely and fearful children, qualities that are inherited generations later by his grandson. Chris Ware's illustrations are simply awe-inspiring in the true sense of the word. It is hard to believe that someone could put so much detail into each of the 380 pages that make up this incredible book, but there is a clue to his devotion in the afterword. After spending most of his life avoiding his own father, speaking only rarely on the phone, Ware finally met up with him: 'Gradually, the sublime outrageousness of our evening eroded into two people simply running out of things to say to each other. We weren't father and son anymore, just a pair of regretful men.'

Readers are drawn into the tension between the emotional bond which Ben and his mother form with Zan, the demands of the research which dominate the attitude of Ben's more inhibited father, and the increasingly fraught relationship he has with his wife and son. Oppel also examines Benâs teenage angst over his own personal relationships, and the ethics of animal experimentation in this absorbing novel.

Jennifer Niven's deeply compelling and highly successful first teen novel All The Bright Places was very much for an older audience with its themes of depression and suicide. Her new book Holding Up the Universe is suitable for younger teens as well - and just as powerfully written. The book is narrated in turns by Libby, famous for once being 'America's Fattest Teen' and starting high school after years of being home schooled, and Jack, who seems to be one of the popular kids but secretly suffers from Prospagnosia - the inability to recognise the faces of familiar people even those in this own family which is often called 'face blindness'. Their worlds collide in a horribly cruel high school game and an unlikely friendship is formed that leads to something even deeper. Jennifer Niven is a gorgeous writer. Her characters Libby and Jack feel so real that it's almost impossible to believe they don't live and breathe. The author herself struggled with weight issues and anxiety over the years, particularly as a teenager, so this writing comes from the heart. The spotlight on prosopagnosia sheds an interesting light on a little known but not so uncommon condition. The ultimate message is uplifting and positive and one that teenagers everywhere need to hear: be yourself and you deserve to be wanted and loved for who you are.Â

The comic-strip adventures of Calvin, a naughty boy with a philosophical bent, and his soft toy tiger companion Hobbes, delighted readers from 1985 to 1995. The huge achievement of the comic's creator Bill Watterson is celebrated here in this wonderful cloth-bound three-volume box set, which contains in chronological order every Calvin and Hobbes strip. For those who have never experienced the sheer delight of Watterson's creation, here is a brief summary: Calvin is an active and imaginative little boy; his friend Hobbes appears as a stuffed tiger when other people are around, but when the two of them are alone he comes to life and is Calvin's friend and playmate. They live with Calvin's long-suffering parents, who have to cope with his turbulent behaviour. The charm of the strip is multi-faceted. On the one hand, Calvin is a typical six-year-old with a vivid imagination: one minute he is fearless intergalactic traveller Spaceman Spiff, crash-landing on a hostile planet, the next he is a fearsome T-Rex stalking his victim through the Jurassic jungle. He is in thrall to consumerism, hates school, loves making gruesome snowmen, and plays Calvinball, an anarchic game of ever-changing rules. Yet he is also given to philosophising about the big issues of life, ably supported or gently undermined by Hobbes's quietly caustic asides . Here is an outlet for Watterson's deeply-held views about the craziness of the modern world; indeed, the artist himself has always shunned publicity. The strip is also enhanced by its strong cast of supporting characters. Mrs Wormwood the teacher looms over Calvin when he not paying attention; the school bully is always on hand to 'pound' him; Susie, the little girl from down the road, often gets her own back on her snowball-throwing nemesis. Calvin's dad is a particularly funny creation: long-suffering, anti-media, and a proponent of fresh air, he also manages to get his revenge on his manic son by tying him up in mental knots with spurious bits of information . All these ingredients would, in the right hands, combine to make a perfectly good comic strip, but what always put Calvin and Hobbes ahead of the competition was the sheer artistry of Watterson's illustrations. In this regard, the chronological arrangement of the strips usefully shows Watterson's increasingly sophisticated technique, from his drawings of desert canyons and hideous inhabitants of alien planets, to the facial expressions of all his characters. It is hard to deny that Watterson owes a debt to Charles Schulz, whose Peanuts strip also offered a sophisticated yet deceptively simple evocation of the inner lives of children. For Calvin and Hobbes, however, Watterson combined uncanny ability, more than a touch of surrealism and a huge dose of humour to distil the essence of late-twentieth-century childhood, thereby elevating his strip into a league of its own.

This extraordinary graphic novel is so obviously a labour of love that the reader can only marvel at the energy that has been expended in its creation. Although the two plots that make up the book are essentially simple, the care with which Ware has executed them gives them an almost mythic quality. Jimmy Corrigan is a lonely, single, thirty-something with a boring job in an office cubicle, and a domineering mother who, in spite of living in a nursing home, is never far from the telephone or Jimmy. His crippling shyness renders him incapable of even saying hello to Peggy, the woman who works at an adjacent desk. When the father he has never known sends him an invitation and a plane ticket, Jimmy feels compelled to fly out to meet him. Jimmy's trip is mirrored by the boyhood tale of his grandfather, James, whose relationship with his father is tainted by unhappiness. Young James's mother has died, leaving his father with the unwanted job of bringing up the little boy alone, while at the same time maintaining his job as a glazier at the 1892 Chicago World's Fair. James is a frightened little boy, cowed by his father and bullied at school; he has a vagueness and fragility common to young, lonely and fearful children, qualities that are inherited generations later by his grandson. Chris Ware's illustrations are simply awe-inspiring in the true sense of the word. It is hard to believe that someone could put so much detail into each of the 380 pages that make up this incredible book, but there is a clue to his devotion in the afterword. After spending most of his life avoiding his own father, speaking only rarely on the phone, Ware finally met up with him: 'Gradually, the sublime outrageousness of our evening eroded into two people simply running out of things to say to each other. We weren't father and son anymore, just a pair of regretful men.'

The book is narrated in turns by Libby, famous for once being 'America's Fattest Teen' and starting high school after years of being home schooled, and Jack, who seems to be one of the popular kids but secretly suffers from Prospagnosia - the inability to recognise the faces of familiar people even those in this own family which is often called 'face blindness'. Their worlds collide in a horribly cruel high school game and an unlikely friendship is formed that leads to something even deeper. Jennifer Niven is a gorgeous writer. Her characters Libby and Jack feel so real that it's almost impossible to believe they don't live and breathe. The author herself struggled with weight issues and anxiety over the years, particularly as a teenager, so this writing comes from the heart. The spotlight on prosopagnosia sheds an interesting light on a little known but not so uncommon condition. The ultimate message is uplifting and positive and one that teenagers everywhere need to hear: be yourself and you deserve to be wanted and loved for who you are.Â

The comic-strip adventures of Calvin, a naughty boy with a philosophical bent, and his soft toy tiger companion Hobbes, delighted readers from 1985 to 1995. The huge achievement of the comic's creator Bill Watterson is celebrated here in this wonderful cloth-bound three-volume box set, which contains in chronological order every Calvin and Hobbes strip. For those who have never experienced the sheer delight of Watterson's creation, here is a brief summary: Calvin is an active and imaginative little boy; his friend Hobbes appears as a stuffed tiger when other people are around, but when the two of them are alone he comes to life and is Calvin's friend and playmate. They live with Calvin's long-suffering parents, who have to cope with his turbulent behaviour. The charm of the strip is multi-faceted. On the one hand, Calvin is a typical six-year-old with a vivid imagination: one minute he is fearless intergalactic traveller Spaceman Spiff, crash-landing on a hostile planet, the next he is a fearsome T-Rex stalking his victim through the Jurassic jungle. He is in thrall to consumerism, hates school, loves making gruesome snowmen, and plays Calvinball, an anarchic game of ever-changing rules. Yet he is also given to philosophising about the big issues of life, ably supported or gently undermined by Hobbes's quietly caustic asides . Here is an outlet for Watterson's deeply-held views about the craziness of the modern world; indeed, the artist himself has always shunned publicity. The strip is also enhanced by its strong cast of supporting characters. Mrs Wormwood the teacher looms over Calvin when he not paying attention; the school bully is always on hand to 'pound' him; Susie, the little girl from down the road, often gets her own back on her snowball-throwing nemesis. Calvin's dad is a particularly funny creation: long-suffering, anti-media, and a proponent of fresh air, he also manages to get his revenge on his manic son by tying him up in mental knots with spurious bits of information . All these ingredients would, in the right hands, combine to make a perfectly good comic strip, but what always put Calvin and Hobbes ahead of the competition was the sheer artistry of Watterson's illustrations. In this regard, the chronological arrangement of the strips usefully shows Watterson's increasingly sophisticated technique, from his drawings of desert canyons and hideous inhabitants of alien planets, to the facial expressions of all his characters. It is hard to deny that Watterson owes a debt to Charles Schulz, whose Peanuts strip also offered a sophisticated yet deceptively simple evocation of the inner lives of children. For Calvin and Hobbes, however, Watterson combined uncanny ability, more than a touch of surrealism and a huge dose of humour to distil the essence of late-twentieth-century childhood, thereby elevating his strip into a league of its own.

This extraordinary graphic novel is so obviously a labour of love that the reader can only marvel at the energy that has been expended in its creation. Although the two plots that make up the book are essentially simple, the care with which Ware has executed them gives them an almost mythic quality. Jimmy Corrigan is a lonely, single, thirty-something with a boring job in an office cubicle, and a domineering mother who, in spite of living in a nursing home, is never far from the telephone or Jimmy. His crippling shyness renders him incapable of even saying hello to Peggy, the woman who works at an adjacent desk. When the father he has never known sends him an invitation and a plane ticket, Jimmy feels compelled to fly out to meet him. Jimmy's trip is mirrored by the boyhood tale of his grandfather, James, whose relationship with his father is tainted by unhappiness. Young James's mother has died, leaving his father with the unwanted job of bringing up the little boy alone, while at the same time maintaining his job as a glazier at the 1892 Chicago World's Fair. James is a frightened little boy, cowed by his father and bullied at school; he has a vagueness and fragility common to young, lonely and fearful children, qualities that are inherited generations later by his grandson. Chris Ware's illustrations are simply awe-inspiring in the true sense of the word. It is hard to believe that someone could put so much detail into each of the 380 pages that make up this incredible book, but there is a clue to his devotion in the afterword. After spending most of his life avoiding his own father, speaking only rarely on the phone, Ware finally met up with him: 'Gradually, the sublime outrageousness of our evening eroded into two people simply running out of things to say to each other. We weren't father and son anymore, just a pair of regretful men.'

Jennifer Niven's deeply compelling and highly successful first teen novel All The Bright Places was very much for an older audience with its themes of depression and suicide. Her new book Holding Up the Universe is suitable for younger teens as well - and just as powerfully written. The book is narrated in turns by Libby, famous for once being 'America's Fattest Teen' and starting high school after years of being home schooled, and Jack, who seems to be one of the popular kids but secretly suffers from Prospagnosia - the inability to recognise the faces of familiar people even those in this own family which is often called 'face blindness'. Their worlds collide in a horribly cruel high school game and an unlikely friendship is formed that leads to something even deeper. Jennifer Niven is a gorgeous writer. Her characters Libby and Jack feel so real that it's almost impossible to believe they don't live and breathe.

The comic-strip adventures of Calvin, a naughty boy with a philosophical bent, and his soft toy tiger companion Hobbes, delighted readers from 1985 to 1995. The huge achievement of the comic's creator Bill Watterson is celebrated here in this wonderful cloth-bound three-volume box set, which contains in chronological order every Calvin and Hobbes strip. For those who have never experienced the sheer delight of Watterson's creation, here is a brief summary: Calvin is an active and imaginative little boy; his friend Hobbes appears as a stuffed tiger when other people are around, but when the two of them are alone he comes to life and is Calvin's friend and playmate. They live with Calvin's long-suffering parents, who have to cope with his turbulent behaviour. The charm of the strip is multi-faceted. On the one hand, Calvin is a typical six-year-old with a vivid imagination: one minute he is fearless intergalactic traveller Spaceman Spiff, crash-landing on a hostile planet, the next he is a fearsome T-Rex stalking his victim through the Jurassic jungle. He is in thrall to consumerism, hates school, loves making gruesome snowmen, and plays Calvinball, an anarchic game of ever-changing rules. Yet he is also given to philosophising about the big issues of life, ably supported or gently undermined by Hobbes's quietly caustic asides . Here is an outlet for Watterson's deeply-held views about the craziness of the modern world; indeed, the artist himself has always shunned publicity. The strip is also enhanced by its strong cast of supporting characters. Mrs Wormwood the teacher looms over Calvin when he not paying attention; the school bully is always on hand to 'pound' him; Susie, the little girl from down the road, often gets her own back on her snowball-throwing nemesis. Calvin's dad is a particularly funny creation: long-suffering, anti-media, and a proponent of fresh air, he also manages to get his revenge on his manic son by tying him up in mental knots with spurious bits of information . All these ingredients would, in the right hands, combine to make a perfectly good comic strip, but what always put Calvin and Hobbes ahead of the competition was the sheer artistry of Watterson's illustrations. In this regard, the chronological arrangement of the strips usefully shows Watterson's increasingly sophisticated technique, from his drawings of desert canyons and hideous inhabitants of alien planets, to the facial expressions of all his characters. It is hard to deny that Watterson owes a debt to Charles Schulz, whose Peanuts strip also offered a sophisticated yet deceptively simple evocation of the inner lives of children. For Calvin and Hobbes, however, Watterson combined uncanny ability, more than a touch of surrealism and a huge dose of humour to distil the essence of late-twentieth-century childhood, thereby elevating his strip into a league of its own.

This extraordinary graphic novel is so obviously a labour of love that the reader can only marvel at the energy that has been expended in its creation. Although the two plots that make up the book are essentially simple, the care with which Ware has executed them gives them an almost mythic quality. Jimmy Corrigan is a lonely, single, thirty-something with a boring job in an office cubicle, and a domineering mother who, in spite of living in a nursing home, is never far from the telephone or Jimmy. His crippling shyness renders him incapable of even saying hello to Peggy, the woman who works at an adjacent desk. When the father he has never known sends him an invitation and a plane ticket, Jimmy feels compelled to fly out to meet him. Jimmy's trip is mirrored by the boyhood tale of his grandfather, James, whose relationship with his father is tainted by unhappiness. Young James's mother has died, leaving his father with the unwanted job of bringing up the little boy alone, while at the same time maintaining his job as a glazier at the 1892 Chicago World's Fair. James is a frightened little boy, cowed by his father and bullied at school; he has a vagueness and fragility common to young, lonely and fearful children, qualities that are inherited generations later by his grandson. Chris Ware's illustrations are simply awe-inspiring in the true sense of the word. It is hard to believe that someone could put so much detail into each of the 380 pages that make up this incredible book, but there is a clue to his devotion in the afterword. After spending most of his life avoiding his own father, speaking only rarely on the phone, Ware finally met up with him: 'Gradually, the sublime outrageousness of our evening eroded into two people simply running out of things to say to each other. We weren't father and son anymore, just a pair of regretful men.'

Jennifer Niven's deeply compelling and highly successful first teen novel All The Bright Places was very much for an older audience with its themes of depression and suicide. Her new book Holding Up the Universe is suitable for younger teens as well - and just as powerfully written. The book is narrated in turns by Libby, famous for once being 'America's Fattest Teen' and starting high school after years of being home schooled, and Jack, who seems to be one of the popular kids but secretly suffers from Prospagnosia - the inability to recognise the faces of familiar people even those in this own family which is often called 'face blindness'. Their worlds collide in a horribly cruel high school game and an unlikely friendship is formed that leads to something even deeper. Jennifer Niven is a gorgeous writer. Her characters Libby and Jack feel so real that it's almost impossible to believe they don't live and breathe. The author herself struggled with weight issues and anxiety over the years, particularly as a teenager, so this writing comes from the heart. The spotlight on prosopagnosia sheds an interesting light on a little known but not so uncommon condition. The ultimate message is uplifting and positive and one that teenagers everywhere need to hear: be yourself and you deserve to be wanted and loved for who you are.Â

The comic-strip adventures of Calvin, a naughty boy with a philosophical bent, and his soft toy tiger companion Hobbes, delighted readers from 1985 to 1995. The huge achievement of the comic's creator Bill Watterson is celebrated here in this wonderful cloth-bound three-volume box set, which contains in chronological order every Calvin and Hobbes strip. For those who have never experienced the sheer delight of Watterson's creation, here is a brief summary: Calvin is an active and imaginative little boy; his friend Hobbes appears as a stuffed tiger when other people are around, but when the two of them are alone he comes to life and is Calvin's friend and playmate. They live with Calvin's long-suffering parents, who have to cope with his turbulent behaviour. The charm of the strip is multi-faceted. On the one hand, Calvin is a typical six-year-old with a vivid imagination: one minute he is fearless intergalactic traveller Spaceman Spiff, crash-landing on a hostile planet, the next he is a fearsome T-Rex stalking his victim through the Jurassic jungle. He is in thrall to consumerism, hates school, loves making gruesome snowmen, and plays Calvinball, an anarchic game of ever-changing rules. Yet he is also given to philosophising about the big issues of life, ably supported or gently undermined by Hobbes's quietly caustic asides . Here is an outlet for Watterson's deeply-held views about the craziness of the modern world; indeed, the artist himself has always shunned publicity. The strip is also enhanced by its strong cast of supporting characters. Mrs Wormwood the teacher looms over Calvin when he not paying attention; the school bully is always on hand to 'pound' him; Susie, the little girl from down the road, often gets her own back on her snowball-throwing nemesis. Calvin's dad is a particularly funny creation: long-suffering, anti-media, and a proponent of fresh air, he also manages to get his revenge on his manic son by tying him up in mental knots with spurious bits of information . All these ingredients would, in the right hands, combine to make a perfectly good comic strip, but what always put Calvin and Hobbes ahead of the competition was the sheer artistry of Watterson's illustrations. In this regard, the chronological arrangement of the strips usefully shows Watterson's increasingly sophisticated technique, from his drawings of desert canyons and hideous inhabitants of alien planets, to the facial expressions of all his characters. It is hard to deny that Watterson owes a debt to Charles Schulz, whose Peanuts strip also offered a sophisticated yet deceptively simple evocation of the inner lives of children. For Calvin and Hobbes, however, Watterson combined uncanny ability, more than a touch of surrealism and a huge dose of humour to distil the essence of late-twentieth-century childhood, thereby elevating his strip into a league of its own.

This extraordinary graphic novel is so obviously a labour of love that the reader can only marvel at the energy that has been expended in its creation. Although the two plots that make up the book are essentially simple, the care with which Ware has executed them gives them an almost mythic quality. Jimmy Corrigan is a lonely, single, thirty-something with a boring job in an office cubicle, and a domineering mother who, in spite of living in a nursing home, is never far from the telephone or Jimmy. His crippling shyness renders him incapable of even saying hello to Peggy, the woman who works at an adjacent desk. When the father he has never known sends him an invitation and a plane ticket, Jimmy feels compelled to fly out to meet him. Jimmy's trip is mirrored by the boyhood tale of his grandfather, James, whose relationship with his father is tainted by unhappiness. Young James's mother has died, leaving his father with the unwanted job of bringing up the little boy alone, while at the same time maintaining his job as a glazier at the 1892 Chicago World's Fair. James is a frightened little boy, cowed by his father and bullied at school; he has a vagueness and fragility common to young, lonely and fearful children, qualities that are inherited generations later by his grandson. Chris Ware's illustrations are simply awe-inspiring in the true sense of the word. It is hard to believe that someone could put so much detail into each of the 380 pages that make up this incredible book, but there is a clue to his devotion in the afterword. After spending most of his life avoiding his own father, speaking only rarely on the phone, Ware finally met up with him: 'Gradually, the sublime outrageousness of our evening eroded into two people simply running out of things to say to each other. We weren't father and son anymore, just a pair of regretful men.'

Jennifer Niven's deeply compelling and highly successful first teen novel All The Bright Places was very much for an older audience with its themes of depression and suicide. Her new book Holding Up the Universe is suitable for younger teens as well - and just as powerfully written. The book is narrated in turns by Libby, famous for once being 'America's Fattest Teen' and starting high school after years of being home schooled, and Jack, who seems to be one of the popular kids but secretly suffers from Prospagnosia - the inability to recognise the faces of familiar people even those in this own family which is often called 'face blindness'. Their worlds collide in a horribly cruel high school game and an unlikely friendship is formed that leads to something even deeper. Jennifer Niven is a gorgeous writer. Her characters Libby and Jack feel so real that it's almost impossible to believe they don't live and breathe. The author herself struggled with weight issues and anxiety over the years, particularly as a teenager, so this writing comes from the heart. The spotlight on prosopagnosia sheds an interesting light on a little known but not so uncommon condition. The ultimate message is uplifting and positive and one that teenagers everywhere need to hear: be yourself and you deserve to be wanted and loved for who you are.Â

For those who have never experienced the sheer delight of Watterson's creation, here is a brief summary: Calvin is an active and imaginative little boy; his friend Hobbes appears as a stuffed tiger when other people are around, but when the two of them are alone he comes to life and is Calvin's friend and playmate. They live with Calvin's long-suffering parents, who have to cope with his turbulent behaviour. The charm of the strip is multi-faceted. On the one hand, Calvin is a typical six-year-old with a vivid imagination: one minute he is fearless intergalactic traveller Spaceman Spiff, crash-landing on a hostile planet, the next he is a fearsome T-Rex stalking his victim through the Jurassic jungle. He is in thrall to consumerism, hates school, loves making gruesome snowmen, and plays Calvinball, an anarchic game of ever-changing rules. Yet he is also given to philosophising about the big issues of life, ably supported or gently undermined by Hobbes's quietly caustic asides . Here is an outlet for Watterson's deeply-held views about the craziness of the modern world; indeed, the artist himself has always shunned publicity. The strip is also enhanced by its strong cast of supporting characters. Mrs Wormwood the teacher looms over Calvin when he not paying attention; the school bully is always on hand to 'pound' him; Susie, the little girl from down the road, often gets her own back on her snowball-throwing nemesis. Calvin's dad is a particularly funny creation: long-suffering, anti-media, and a proponent of fresh air, he also manages to get his revenge on his manic son by tying him up in mental knots with spurious bits of information . All these ingredients would, in the right hands, combine to make a perfectly good comic strip, but what always put Calvin and Hobbes ahead of the competition was the sheer artistry of Watterson's illustrations. In this regard, the chronological arrangement of the strips usefully shows Watterson's increasingly sophisticated technique, from his drawings of desert canyons and hideous inhabitants of alien planets, to the facial expressions of all his characters. It is hard to deny that Watterson owes a debt to Charles Schulz, whose Peanuts strip also offered a sophisticated yet deceptively simple evocation of the inner lives of children. For Calvin and Hobbes, however, Watterson combined uncanny ability, more than a touch of surrealism and a huge dose of humour to distil the essence of late-twentieth-century childhood, thereby elevating his strip into a league of its own.

This extraordinary graphic novel is so obviously a labour of love that the reader can only marvel at the energy that has been expended in its creation. Although the two plots that make up the book are essentially simple, the care with which Ware has executed them gives them an almost mythic quality. Jimmy Corrigan is a lonely, single, thirty-something with a boring job in an office cubicle, and a domineering mother who, in spite of living in a nursing home, is never far from the telephone or Jimmy. His crippling shyness renders him incapable of even saying hello to Peggy, the woman who works at an adjacent desk. When the father he has never known sends him an invitation and a plane ticket, Jimmy feels compelled to fly out to meet him. Jimmy's trip is mirrored by the boyhood tale of his grandfather, James, whose relationship with his father is tainted by unhappiness. Young James's mother has died, leaving his father with the unwanted job of bringing up the little boy alone, while at the same time maintaining his job as a glazier at the 1892 Chicago World's Fair. James is a frightened little boy, cowed by his father and bullied at school; he has a vagueness and fragility common to young, lonely and fearful children, qualities that are inherited generations later by his grandson. Chris Ware's illustrations are simply awe-inspiring in the true sense of the word. It is hard to believe that someone could put so much detail into each of the 380 pages that make up this incredible book, but there is a clue to his devotion in the afterword. After spending most of his life avoiding his own father, speaking only rarely on the phone, Ware finally met up with him: 'Gradually, the sublime outrageousness of our evening eroded into two people simply running out of things to say to each other. We weren't father and son anymore, just a pair of regretful men.'

But nothing is straightforward, and when Luna turns 13, everything will change. Kelly Barnhill won the Newbery Medal in the US for this thoughtful and magical book about belonging, fear and family, and itâs easy to see why.

Jennifer Niven's deeply compelling and highly successful first teen novel All The Bright Places was very much for an older audience with its themes of depression and suicide. Her new book Holding Up the Universe is suitable for younger teens as well - and just as powerfully written. The book is narrated in turns by Libby, famous for once being 'America's Fattest Teen' and starting high school after years of being home schooled, and Jack, who seems to be one of the popular kids but secretly suffers from Prospagnosia - the inability to recognise the faces of familiar people even those in this own family which is often called 'face blindness'. Their worlds collide in a horribly cruel high school game and an unlikely friendship is formed that leads to something even deeper. Jennifer Niven is a gorgeous writer. Her characters Libby and Jack feel so real that it's almost impossible to believe they don't live and breathe. The author herself struggled with weight issues and anxiety over the years, particularly as a teenager, so this writing comes from the heart. The spotlight on prosopagnosia sheds an interesting light on a little known but not so uncommon condition. The ultimate message is uplifting and positive and one that teenagers everywhere need to hear: be yourself and you deserve to be wanted and loved for who you are.Â

The comic-strip adventures of Calvin, a naughty boy with a philosophical bent, and his soft toy tiger companion Hobbes, delighted readers from 1985 to 1995. The huge achievement of the comic's creator Bill Watterson is celebrated here in this wonderful cloth-bound three-volume box set, which contains in chronological order every Calvin and Hobbes strip. For those who have never experienced the sheer delight of Watterson's creation, here is a brief summary: Calvin is an active and imaginative little boy; his friend Hobbes appears as a stuffed tiger when other people are around, but when the two of them are alone he comes to life and is Calvin's friend and playmate. They live with Calvin's long-suffering parents, who have to cope with his turbulent behaviour. The charm of the strip is multi-faceted. On the one hand, Calvin is a typical six-year-old with a vivid imagination: one minute he is fearless intergalactic traveller Spaceman Spiff, crash-landing on a hostile planet, the next he is a fearsome T-Rex stalking his victim through the Jurassic jungle. He is in thrall to consumerism, hates school, loves making gruesome snowmen, and plays Calvinball, an anarchic game of ever-changing rules. Yet he is also given to philosophising about the big issues of life, ably supported or gently undermined by Hobbes's quietly caustic asides . Here is an outlet for Watterson's deeply-held views about the craziness of the modern world; indeed, the artist himself has always shunned publicity. The strip is also enhanced by its strong cast of supporting characters. Mrs Wormwood the teacher looms over Calvin when he not paying attention; the school bully is always on hand to 'pound' him; Susie, the little girl from down the road, often gets her own back on her snowball-throwing nemesis. Calvin's dad is a particularly funny creation: long-suffering, anti-media, and a proponent of fresh air, he also manages to get his revenge on his manic son by tying him up in mental knots with spurious bits of information . All these ingredients would, in the right hands, combine to make a perfectly good comic strip, but what always put Calvin and Hobbes ahead of the competition was the sheer artistry of Watterson's illustrations. In this regard, the chronological arrangement of the strips usefully shows Watterson's increasingly sophisticated technique, from his drawings of desert canyons and hideous inhabitants of alien planets, to the facial expressions of all his characters. It is hard to deny that Watterson owes a debt to Charles Schulz, whose Peanuts strip also offered a sophisticated yet deceptively simple evocation of the inner lives of children. For Calvin and Hobbes, however, Watterson combined uncanny ability, more than a touch of surrealism and a huge dose of humour to distil the essence of late-twentieth-century childhood, thereby elevating his strip into a league of its own.

This extraordinary graphic novel is so obviously a labour of love that the reader can only marvel at the energy that has been expended in its creation. Although the two plots that make up the book are essentially simple, the care with which Ware has executed them gives them an almost mythic quality. Jimmy Corrigan is a lonely, single, thirty-something with a boring job in an office cubicle, and a domineering mother who, in spite of living in a nursing home, is never far from the telephone or Jimmy. His crippling shyness renders him incapable of even saying hello to Peggy, the woman who works at an adjacent desk. When the father he has never known sends him an invitation and a plane ticket, Jimmy feels compelled to fly out to meet him. Jimmy's trip is mirrored by the boyhood tale of his grandfather, James, whose relationship with his father is tainted by unhappiness. Young James's mother has died, leaving his father with the unwanted job of bringing up the little boy alone, while at the same time maintaining his job as a glazier at the 1892 Chicago World's Fair. James is a frightened little boy, cowed by his father and bullied at school; he has a vagueness and fragility common to young, lonely and fearful children, qualities that are inherited generations later by his grandson. Chris Ware's illustrations are simply awe-inspiring in the true sense of the word. It is hard to believe that someone could put so much detail into each of the 380 pages that make up this incredible book, but there is a clue to his devotion in the afterword. After spending most of his life avoiding his own father, speaking only rarely on the phone, Ware finally met up with him: 'Gradually, the sublime outrageousness of our evening eroded into two people simply running out of things to say to each other. We weren't father and son anymore, just a pair of regretful men.'

Jennifer Niven's deeply compelling and highly successful first teen novel All The Bright Places was very much for an older audience with its themes of depression and suicide. Her new book Holding Up the Universe is suitable for younger teens as well - and just as powerfully written. The book is narrated in turns by Libby, famous for once being 'America's Fattest Teen' and starting high school after years of being home schooled, and Jack, who seems to be one of the popular kids but secretly suffers from Prospagnosia - the inability to recognise the faces of familiar people even those in this own family which is often called 'face blindness'. Their worlds collide in a horribly cruel high school game and an unlikely friendship is formed that leads to something even deeper. Jennifer Niven is a gorgeous writer. Her characters Libby and Jack feel so real that it's almost impossible to believe they don't live and breathe. The author herself struggled with weight issues and anxiety over the years, particularly as a teenager, so this writing comes from the heart. The spotlight on prosopagnosia sheds an interesting light on a little known but not so uncommon condition. The ultimate message is uplifting and positive and one that teenagers everywhere need to hear: be yourself and you deserve to be wanted and loved for who you are.Â

The comic-strip adventures of Calvin, a naughty boy with a philosophical bent, and his soft toy tiger companion Hobbes, delighted readers from 1985 to 1995. The huge achievement of the comic's creator Bill Watterson is celebrated here in this wonderful cloth-bound three-volume box set, which contains in chronological order every Calvin and Hobbes strip. For those who have never experienced the sheer delight of Watterson's creation, here is a brief summary: Calvin is an active and imaginative little boy; his friend Hobbes appears as a stuffed tiger when other people are around, but when the two of them are alone he comes to life and is Calvin's friend and playmate. They live with Calvin's long-suffering parents, who have to cope with his turbulent behaviour. The charm of the strip is multi-faceted. On the one hand, Calvin is a typical six-year-old with a vivid imagination: one minute he is fearless intergalactic traveller Spaceman Spiff, crash-landing on a hostile planet, the next he is a fearsome T-Rex stalking his victim through the Jurassic jungle. He is in thrall to consumerism, hates school, loves making gruesome snowmen, and plays Calvinball, an anarchic game of ever-changing rules. Yet he is also given to philosophising about the big issues of life, ably supported or gently undermined by Hobbes's quietly caustic asides . Here is an outlet for Watterson's deeply-held views about the craziness of the modern world; indeed, the artist himself has always shunned publicity. The strip is also enhanced by its strong cast of supporting characters. Mrs Wormwood the teacher looms over Calvin when he not paying attention; the school bully is always on hand to 'pound' him; Susie, the little girl from down the road, often gets her own back on her snowball-throwing nemesis. Calvin's dad is a particularly funny creation: long-suffering, anti-media, and a proponent of fresh air, he also manages to get his revenge on his manic son by tying him up in mental knots with spurious bits of information . All these ingredients would, in the right hands, combine to make a perfectly good comic strip, but what always put Calvin and Hobbes ahead of the competition was the sheer artistry of Watterson's illustrations. In this regard, the chronological arrangement of the strips usefully shows Watterson's increasingly sophisticated technique, from his drawings of desert canyons and hideous inhabitants of alien planets, to the facial expressions of all his characters. It is hard to deny that Watterson owes a debt to Charles Schulz, whose Peanuts strip also offered a sophisticated yet deceptively simple evocation of the inner lives of children. For Calvin and Hobbes, however, Watterson combined uncanny ability, more than a touch of surrealism and a huge dose of humour to distil the essence of late-twentieth-century childhood, thereby elevating his strip into a league of its own.

On the eve of battle, Sir Thomas Lemuel Hawke of Cornwall writes a letter to his children. It is a guide on how to live well, like a knight: staying wise, humble, courageous, loving and kind. Hawke has tried to make this book look as authentic as possible. The cover stands out with a gold-embossed leaf. Inside, an editorâs note talks about the discovery of the âhistoricalâ letter, confirming Sir Thomas's death at the Battle of Slaughter Bridge in 1483.It all gives the book an important and timeless feel. Hawke has a way with a sentence, and many of the sections read like note-perfect proverbs. There are also some lovely, tender scenes with the grandfather.

This extraordinary graphic novel is so obviously a labour of love that the reader can only marvel at the energy that has been expended in its creation. Although the two plots that make up the book are essentially simple, the care with which Ware has executed them gives them an almost mythic quality. Jimmy Corrigan is a lonely, single, thirty-something with a boring job in an office cubicle, and a domineering mother who, in spite of living in a nursing home, is never far from the telephone or Jimmy. His crippling shyness renders him incapable of even saying hello to Peggy, the woman who works at an adjacent desk. When the father he has never known sends him an invitation and a plane ticket, Jimmy feels compelled to fly out to meet him. Jimmy's trip is mirrored by the boyhood tale of his grandfather, James, whose relationship with his father is tainted by unhappiness. Young James's mother has died, leaving his father with the unwanted job of bringing up the little boy alone, while at the same time maintaining his job as a glazier at the 1892 Chicago World's Fair. James is a frightened little boy, cowed by his father and bullied at school; he has a vagueness and fragility common to young, lonely and fearful children, qualities that are inherited generations later by his grandson. Chris Ware's illustrations are simply awe-inspiring in the true sense of the word. It is hard to believe that someone could put so much detail into each of the 380 pages that make up this incredible book, but there is a clue to his devotion in the afterword. After spending most of his life avoiding his own father, speaking only rarely on the phone, Ware finally met up with him: 'Gradually, the sublime outrageousness of our evening eroded into two people simply running out of things to say to each other. We weren't father and son anymore, just a pair of regretful men.'

But nothing is straightforward, and when Luna turns 13, everything will change. Kelly Barnhill won the Newbery Medal in the US for this thoughtful and magical book about belonging, fear and family, and itâs easy to see why.

Oppel bases his first YA novel on projects in the 1970s which tested the capability of chimpanzees to acquire sign language.

Jennifer Niven's deeply compelling and highly successful first teen novel All The Bright Places was very much for an older audience with its themes of depression and suicide. Her new book Holding Up the Universe is suitable for younger teens as well - and just as powerfully written. The book is narrated in turns by Libby, famous for once being 'America's Fattest Teen' and starting high school after years of being home schooled, and Jack, who seems to be one of the popular kids but secretly suffers from Prospagnosia - the inability to recognise the faces of familiar people even those in this own family which is often called 'face blindness'. Their worlds collide in a horribly cruel high school game and an unlikely friendship is formed that leads to something even deeper. Jennifer Niven is a gorgeous writer. Her characters Libby and Jack feel so real that it's almost impossible to believe they don't live and breathe. The author herself struggled with weight issues and anxiety over the years, particularly as a teenager, so this writing comes from the heart. The spotlight on prosopagnosia sheds an interesting light on a little known but not so uncommon condition. The ultimate message is uplifting and positive and one that teenagers everywhere need to hear: be yourself and you deserve to be wanted and loved for who you are.Â

The comic-strip adventures of Calvin, a naughty boy with a philosophical bent, and his soft toy tiger companion Hobbes, delighted readers from 1985 to 1995. The huge achievement of the comic's creator Bill Watterson is celebrated here in this wonderful cloth-bound three-volume box set, which contains in chronological order every Calvin and Hobbes strip. For those who have never experienced the sheer delight of Watterson's creation, here is a brief summary: Calvin is an active and imaginative little boy; his friend Hobbes appears as a stuffed tiger when other people are around, but when the two of them are alone he comes to life and is Calvin's friend and playmate. They live with Calvin's long-suffering parents, who have to cope with his turbulent behaviour. The charm of the strip is multi-faceted. On the one hand, Calvin is a typical six-year-old with a vivid imagination: one minute he is fearless intergalactic traveller Spaceman Spiff, crash-landing on a hostile planet, the next he is a fearsome T-Rex stalking his victim through the Jurassic jungle. He is in thrall to consumerism, hates school, loves making gruesome snowmen, and plays Calvinball, an anarchic game of ever-changing rules. Yet he is also given to philosophising about the big issues of life, ably supported or gently undermined by Hobbes's quietly caustic asides . Here is an outlet for Watterson's deeply-held views about the craziness of the modern world; indeed, the artist himself has always shunned publicity. The strip is also enhanced by its strong cast of supporting characters. Mrs Wormwood the teacher looms over Calvin when he not paying attention; the school bully is always on hand to 'pound' him; Susie, the little girl from down the road, often gets her own back on her snowball-throwing nemesis. Calvin's dad is a particularly funny creation: long-suffering, anti-media, and a proponent of fresh air, he also manages to get his revenge on his manic son by tying him up in mental knots with spurious bits of information . All these ingredients would, in the right hands, combine to make a perfectly good comic strip, but what always put Calvin and Hobbes ahead of the competition was the sheer artistry of Watterson's illustrations. In this regard, the chronological arrangement of the strips usefully shows Watterson's increasingly sophisticated technique, from his drawings of desert canyons and hideous inhabitants of alien planets, to the facial expressions of all his characters. It is hard to deny that Watterson owes a debt to Charles Schulz, whose Peanuts strip also offered a sophisticated yet deceptively simple evocation of the inner lives of children. For Calvin and Hobbes, however, Watterson combined uncanny ability, more than a touch of surrealism and a huge dose of humour to distil the essence of late-twentieth-century childhood, thereby elevating his strip into a league of its own.

On the eve of battle, Sir Thomas Lemuel Hawke of Cornwall writes a letter to his children. It is a guide on how to live well, like a knight: staying wise, humble, courageous, loving and kind. Hawke has tried to make this book look as authentic as possible. The cover stands out with a gold-embossed leaf. Inside, an editorâs note talks about the discovery of the âhistoricalâ letter, confirming Sir Thomas's death at the Battle of Slaughter Bridge in 1483.It all gives the book an important and timeless feel. Hawke has a way with a sentence, and many of the sections read like note-perfect proverbs. There are also some lovely, tender scenes with the grandfather. It can be a little dense at times, so children may want to dip in and out of the short, standalone chapters. But the book is pitched in such a way that they can get new meaning from it as they grow into teenagers and young adults.

This extraordinary graphic novel is so obviously a labour of love that the reader can only marvel at the energy that has been expended in its creation. Although the two plots that make up the book are essentially simple, the care with which Ware has executed them gives them an almost mythic quality. Jimmy Corrigan is a lonely, single, thirty-something with a boring job in an office cubicle, and a domineering mother who, in spite of living in a nursing home, is never far from the telephone or Jimmy. His crippling shyness renders him incapable of even saying hello to Peggy, the woman who works at an adjacent desk. When the father he has never known sends him an invitation and a plane ticket, Jimmy feels compelled to fly out to meet him. Jimmy's trip is mirrored by the boyhood tale of his grandfather, James, whose relationship with his father is tainted by unhappiness. Young James's mother has died, leaving his father with the unwanted job of bringing up the little boy alone, while at the same time maintaining his job as a glazier at the 1892 Chicago World's Fair. James is a frightened little boy, cowed by his father and bullied at school; he has a vagueness and fragility common to young, lonely and fearful children, qualities that are inherited generations later by his grandson. Chris Ware's illustrations are simply awe-inspiring in the true sense of the word. It is hard to believe that someone could put so much detail into each of the 380 pages that make up this incredible book, but there is a clue to his devotion in the afterword. After spending most of his life avoiding his own father, speaking only rarely on the phone, Ware finally met up with him: 'Gradually, the sublime outrageousness of our evening eroded into two people simply running out of things to say to each other. We weren't father and son anymore, just a pair of regretful men.'

Kelly Barnhill won the Newbery Medal in the US for this thoughtful and magical book about belonging, fear and family, and itâs easy to see why.

Jennifer Niven's deeply compelling and highly successful first teen novel All The Bright Places was very much for an older audience with its themes of depression and suicide. Her new book Holding Up the Universe is suitable for younger teens as well - and just as powerfully written. The book is narrated in turns by Libby, famous for once being 'America's Fattest Teen' and starting high school after years of being home schooled, and Jack, who seems to be one of the popular kids but secretly suffers from Prospagnosia - the inability to recognise the faces of familiar people even those in this own family which is often called 'face blindness'. Their worlds collide in a horribly cruel high school game and an unlikely friendship is formed that leads to something even deeper. Jennifer Niven is a gorgeous writer. Her characters Libby and Jack feel so real that it's almost impossible to believe they don't live and breathe. The author herself struggled with weight issues and anxiety over the years, particularly as a teenager, so this writing comes from the heart. The spotlight on prosopagnosia sheds an interesting light on a little known but not so uncommon condition. The ultimate message is uplifting and positive and one that teenagers everywhere need to hear: be yourself and you deserve to be wanted and loved for who you are.Â

The comic-strip adventures of Calvin, a naughty boy with a philosophical bent, and his soft toy tiger companion Hobbes, delighted readers from 1985 to 1995. The huge achievement of the comic's creator Bill Watterson is celebrated here in this wonderful cloth-bound three-volume box set, which contains in chronological order every Calvin and Hobbes strip. For those who have never experienced the sheer delight of Watterson's creation, here is a brief summary: Calvin is an active and imaginative little boy; his friend Hobbes appears as a stuffed tiger when other people are around, but when the two of them are alone he comes to life and is Calvin's friend and playmate. They live with Calvin's long-suffering parents, who have to cope with his turbulent behaviour. The charm of the strip is multi-faceted. On the one hand, Calvin is a typical six-year-old with a vivid imagination: one minute he is fearless intergalactic traveller Spaceman Spiff, crash-landing on a hostile planet, the next he is a fearsome T-Rex stalking his victim through the Jurassic jungle. He is in thrall to consumerism, hates school, loves making gruesome snowmen, and plays Calvinball, an anarchic game of ever-changing rules. Yet he is also given to philosophising about the big issues of life, ably supported or gently undermined by Hobbes's quietly caustic asides . Here is an outlet for Watterson's deeply-held views about the craziness of the modern world; indeed, the artist himself has always shunned publicity. The strip is also enhanced by its strong cast of supporting characters. Mrs Wormwood the teacher looms over Calvin when he not paying attention; the school bully is always on hand to 'pound' him; Susie, the little girl from down the road, often gets her own back on her snowball-throwing nemesis. Calvin's dad is a particularly funny creation: long-suffering, anti-media, and a proponent of fresh air, he also manages to get his revenge on his manic son by tying him up in mental knots with spurious bits of information . All these ingredients would, in the right hands, combine to make a perfectly good comic strip, but what always put Calvin and Hobbes ahead of the competition was the sheer artistry of Watterson's illustrations. In this regard, the chronological arrangement of the strips usefully shows Watterson's increasingly sophisticated technique, from his drawings of desert canyons and hideous inhabitants of alien planets, to the facial expressions of all his characters. It is hard to deny that Watterson owes a debt to Charles Schulz, whose Peanuts strip also offered a sophisticated yet deceptively simple evocation of the inner lives of children. For Calvin and Hobbes, however, Watterson combined uncanny ability, more than a touch of surrealism and a huge dose of humour to distil the essence of late-twentieth-century childhood, thereby elevating his strip into a league of its own.

This extraordinary graphic novel is so obviously a labour of love that the reader can only marvel at the energy that has been expended in its creation. Although the two plots that make up the book are essentially simple, the care with which Ware has executed them gives them an almost mythic quality. Jimmy Corrigan is a lonely, single, thirty-something with a boring job in an office cubicle, and a domineering mother who, in spite of living in a nursing home, is never far from the telephone or Jimmy. His crippling shyness renders him incapable of even saying hello to Peggy, the woman who works at an adjacent desk. When the father he has never known sends him an invitation and a plane ticket, Jimmy feels compelled to fly out to meet him. Jimmy's trip is mirrored by the boyhood tale of his grandfather, James, whose relationship with his father is tainted by unhappiness. Young James's mother has died, leaving his father with the unwanted job of bringing up the little boy alone, while at the same time maintaining his job as a glazier at the 1892 Chicago World's Fair. James is a frightened little boy, cowed by his father and bullied at school; he has a vagueness and fragility common to young, lonely and fearful children, qualities that are inherited generations later by his grandson. Chris Ware's illustrations are simply awe-inspiring in the true sense of the word. It is hard to believe that someone could put so much detail into each of the 380 pages that make up this incredible book, but there is a clue to his devotion in the afterword. After spending most of his life avoiding his own father, speaking only rarely on the phone, Ware finally met up with him: 'Gradually, the sublime outrageousness of our evening eroded into two people simply running out of things to say to each other. We weren't father and son anymore, just a pair of regretful men.'

But nothing is straightforward, and when Luna turns 13, everything will change. Kelly Barnhill won the Newbery Medal in the US for this thoughtful and magical book about belonging, fear and family, and itâs easy to see why.

Jennifer Niven's deeply compelling and highly successful first teen novel All The Bright Places was very much for an older audience with its themes of depression and suicide. Her new book Holding Up the Universe is suitable for younger teens as well - and just as powerfully written. The book is narrated in turns by Libby, famous for once being 'America's Fattest Teen' and starting high school after years of being home schooled, and Jack, who seems to be one of the popular kids but secretly suffers from Prospagnosia - the inability to recognise the faces of familiar people even those in this own family which is often called 'face blindness'. Their worlds collide in a horribly cruel high school game and an unlikely friendship is formed that leads to something even deeper. Jennifer Niven is a gorgeous writer. Her characters Libby and Jack feel so real that it's almost impossible to believe they don't live and breathe. The author herself struggled with weight issues and anxiety over the years, particularly as a teenager, so this writing comes from the heart. The spotlight on prosopagnosia sheds an interesting light on a little known but not so uncommon condition. The ultimate message is uplifting and positive and one that teenagers everywhere need to hear: be yourself and you deserve to be wanted and loved for who you are.Â

The comic-strip adventures of Calvin, a naughty boy with a philosophical bent, and his soft toy tiger companion Hobbes, delighted readers from 1985 to 1995. The huge achievement of the comic's creator Bill Watterson is celebrated here in this wonderful cloth-bound three-volume box set, which contains in chronological order every Calvin and Hobbes strip. For those who have never experienced the sheer delight of Watterson's creation, here is a brief summary: Calvin is an active and imaginative little boy; his friend Hobbes appears as a stuffed tiger when other people are around, but when the two of them are alone he comes to life and is Calvin's friend and playmate. They live with Calvin's long-suffering parents, who have to cope with his turbulent behaviour. The charm of the strip is multi-faceted. On the one hand, Calvin is a typical six-year-old with a vivid imagination: one minute he is fearless intergalactic traveller Spaceman Spiff, crash-landing on a hostile planet, the next he is a fearsome T-Rex stalking his victim through the Jurassic jungle. He is in thrall to consumerism, hates school, loves making gruesome snowmen, and plays Calvinball, an anarchic game of ever-changing rules. Yet he is also given to philosophising about the big issues of life, ably supported or gently undermined by Hobbes's quietly caustic asides . Here is an outlet for Watterson's deeply-held views about the craziness of the modern world; indeed, the artist himself has always shunned publicity. The strip is also enhanced by its strong cast of supporting characters. Mrs Wormwood the teacher looms over Calvin when he not paying attention; the school bully is always on hand to 'pound' him; Susie, the little girl from down the road, often gets her own back on her snowball-throwing nemesis. Calvin's dad is a particularly funny creation: long-suffering, anti-media, and a proponent of fresh air, he also manages to get his revenge on his manic son by tying him up in mental knots with spurious bits of information . All these ingredients would, in the right hands, combine to make a perfectly good comic strip, but what always put Calvin and Hobbes ahead of the competition was the sheer artistry of Watterson's illustrations. In this regard, the chronological arrangement of the strips usefully shows Watterson's increasingly sophisticated technique, from his drawings of desert canyons and hideous inhabitants of alien planets, to the facial expressions of all his characters. It is hard to deny that Watterson owes a debt to Charles Schulz, whose Peanuts strip also offered a sophisticated yet deceptively simple evocation of the inner lives of children. For Calvin and Hobbes, however, Watterson combined uncanny ability, more than a touch of surrealism and a huge dose of humour to distil the essence of late-twentieth-century childhood, thereby elevating his strip into a league of its own.

This extraordinary graphic novel is so obviously a labour of love that the reader can only marvel at the energy that has been expended in its creation. Although the two plots that make up the book are essentially simple, the care with which Ware has executed them gives them an almost mythic quality. Jimmy Corrigan is a lonely, single, thirty-something with a boring job in an office cubicle, and a domineering mother who, in spite of living in a nursing home, is never far from the telephone or Jimmy. His crippling shyness renders him incapable of even saying hello to Peggy, the woman who works at an adjacent desk. When the father he has never known sends him an invitation and a plane ticket, Jimmy feels compelled to fly out to meet him. Jimmy's trip is mirrored by the boyhood tale of his grandfather, James, whose relationship with his father is tainted by unhappiness. Young James's mother has died, leaving his father with the unwanted job of bringing up the little boy alone, while at the same time maintaining his job as a glazier at the 1892 Chicago World's Fair. James is a frightened little boy, cowed by his father and bullied at school; he has a vagueness and fragility common to young, lonely and fearful children, qualities that are inherited generations later by his grandson. Chris Ware's illustrations are simply awe-inspiring in the true sense of the word. It is hard to believe that someone could put so much detail into each of the 380 pages that make up this incredible book, but there is a clue to his devotion in the afterword. After spending most of his life avoiding his own father, speaking only rarely on the phone, Ware finally met up with him: 'Gradually, the sublime outrageousness of our evening eroded into two people simply running out of things to say to each other. We weren't father and son anymore, just a pair of regretful men.'

Kelly Barnhill won the Newbery Medal in the US for this thoughtful and magical book about belonging, fear and family, and itâs easy to see why.

Jennifer Niven's deeply compelling and highly successful first teen novel All The Bright Places was very much for an older audience with its themes of depression and suicide. Her new book Holding Up the Universe is suitable for younger teens as well - and just as powerfully written. The book is narrated in turns by Libby, famous for once being 'America's Fattest Teen' and starting high school after years of being home schooled, and Jack, who seems to be one of the popular kids but secretly suffers from Prospagnosia - the inability to recognise the faces of familiar people even those in this own family which is often called 'face blindness'. Their worlds collide in a horribly cruel high school game and an unlikely friendship is formed that leads to something even deeper. Jennifer Niven is a gorgeous writer. Her characters Libby and Jack feel so real that it's almost impossible to believe they don't live and breathe. The author herself struggled with weight issues and anxiety over the years, particularly as a teenager, so this writing comes from the heart. The spotlight on prosopagnosia sheds an interesting light on a little known but not so uncommon condition. The ultimate message is uplifting and positive and one that teenagers everywhere need to hear: be yourself and you deserve to be wanted and loved for who you are.Â

The comic-strip adventures of Calvin, a naughty boy with a philosophical bent, and his soft toy tiger companion Hobbes, delighted readers from 1985 to 1995. The huge achievement of the comic's creator Bill Watterson is celebrated here in this wonderful cloth-bound three-volume box set, which contains in chronological order every Calvin and Hobbes strip. For those who have never experienced the sheer delight of Watterson's creation, here is a brief summary: Calvin is an active and imaginative little boy; his friend Hobbes appears as a stuffed tiger when other people are around, but when the two of them are alone he comes to life and is Calvin's friend and playmate. They live with Calvin's long-suffering parents, who have to cope with his turbulent behaviour. The charm of the strip is multi-faceted. On the one hand, Calvin is a typical six-year-old with a vivid imagination: one minute he is fearless intergalactic traveller Spaceman Spiff, crash-landing on a hostile planet, the next he is a fearsome T-Rex stalking his victim through the Jurassic jungle. He is in thrall to consumerism, hates school, loves making gruesome snowmen, and plays Calvinball, an anarchic game of ever-changing rules. Yet he is also given to philosophising about the big issues of life, ably supported or gently undermined by Hobbes's quietly caustic asides . Here is an outlet for Watterson's deeply-held views about the craziness of the modern world; indeed, the artist himself has always shunned publicity. The strip is also enhanced by its strong cast of supporting characters. Mrs Wormwood the teacher looms over Calvin when he not paying attention; the school bully is always on hand to 'pound' him; Susie, the little girl from down the road, often gets her own back on her snowball-throwing nemesis. Calvin's dad is a particularly funny creation: long-suffering, anti-media, and a proponent of fresh air, he also manages to get his revenge on his manic son by tying him up in mental knots with spurious bits of information . All these ingredients would, in the right hands, combine to make a perfectly good comic strip, but what always put Calvin and Hobbes ahead of the competition was the sheer artistry of Watterson's illustrations. In this regard, the chronological arrangement of the strips usefully shows Watterson's increasingly sophisticated technique, from his drawings of desert canyons and hideous inhabitants of alien planets, to the facial expressions of all his characters. It is hard to deny that Watterson owes a debt to Charles Schulz, whose Peanuts strip also offered a sophisticated yet deceptively simple evocation of the inner lives of children. For Calvin and Hobbes, however, Watterson combined uncanny ability, more than a touch of surrealism and a huge dose of humour to distil the essence of late-twentieth-century childhood, thereby elevating his strip into a league of its own.

On the eve of battle, Sir Thomas Lemuel Hawke of Cornwall writes a letter to his children. It is a guide on how to live well, like a knight: staying wise, humble, courageous, loving and kind. Hawke has tried to make this book look as authentic as possible. The cover stands out with a gold-embossed leaf. Inside, an editorâs note talks about the discovery of the âhistoricalâ letter, confirming Sir Thomas's death at the Battle of Slaughter Bridge in 1483.It all gives the book an important and timeless feel.

This extraordinary graphic novel is so obviously a labour of love that the reader can only marvel at the energy that has been expended in its creation. Although the two plots that make up the book are essentially simple, the care with which Ware has executed them gives them an almost mythic quality. Jimmy Corrigan is a lonely, single, thirty-something with a boring job in an office cubicle, and a domineering mother who, in spite of living in a nursing home, is never far from the telephone or Jimmy. His crippling shyness renders him incapable of even saying hello to Peggy, the woman who works at an adjacent desk. When the father he has never known sends him an invitation and a plane ticket, Jimmy feels compelled to fly out to meet him. Jimmy's trip is mirrored by the boyhood tale of his grandfather, James, whose relationship with his father is tainted by unhappiness. Young James's mother has died, leaving his father with the unwanted job of bringing up the little boy alone, while at the same time maintaining his job as a glazier at the 1892 Chicago World's Fair. James is a frightened little boy, cowed by his father and bullied at school; he has a vagueness and fragility common to young, lonely and fearful children, qualities that are inherited generations later by his grandson. Chris Ware's illustrations are simply awe-inspiring in the true sense of the word. It is hard to believe that someone could put so much detail into each of the 380 pages that make up this incredible book, but there is a clue to his devotion in the afterword. After spending most of his life avoiding his own father, speaking only rarely on the phone, Ware finally met up with him: 'Gradually, the sublime outrageousness of our evening eroded into two people simply running out of things to say to each other. We weren't father and son anymore, just a pair of regretful men.'

Yet, unknown to them, the witch is Xan, the plump and knowledgeable protector of the babies that she takes to the neighbouring village to be raised as special children, fed on starlight and destined to do wonderful things.

Kelly Barnhill won the Newbery Medal in the US for this thoughtful and magical book about belonging, fear and family, and itâs easy to see why.

Xan is a delightfully pleasant and caring crone witch who dispels the traditional image of cackling evildoer, and replaces it with something far more loving and magical.

Jennifer Niven's deeply compelling and highly successful first teen novel All The Bright Places was very much for an older audience with its themes of depression and suicide. Her new book Holding Up the Universe is suitable for younger teens as well - and just as powerfully written. The book is narrated in turns by Libby, famous for once being 'America's Fattest Teen' and starting high school after years of being home schooled, and Jack, who seems to be one of the popular kids but secretly suffers from Prospagnosia - the inability to recognise the faces of familiar people even those in this own family which is often called 'face blindness'. Their worlds collide in a horribly cruel high school game and an unlikely friendship is formed that leads to something even deeper. Jennifer Niven is a gorgeous writer. Her characters Libby and Jack feel so real that it's almost impossible to believe they don't live and breathe. The author herself struggled with weight issues and anxiety over the years, particularly as a teenager, so this writing comes from the heart. The spotlight on prosopagnosia sheds an interesting light on a little known but not so uncommon condition. The ultimate message is uplifting and positive and one that teenagers everywhere need to hear: be yourself and you deserve to be wanted and loved for who you are.Â

The comic-strip adventures of Calvin, a naughty boy with a philosophical bent, and his soft toy tiger companion Hobbes, delighted readers from 1985 to 1995. The huge achievement of the comic's creator Bill Watterson is celebrated here in this wonderful cloth-bound three-volume box set, which contains in chronological order every Calvin and Hobbes strip. For those who have never experienced the sheer delight of Watterson's creation, here is a brief summary: Calvin is an active and imaginative little boy; his friend Hobbes appears as a stuffed tiger when other people are around, but when the two of them are alone he comes to life and is Calvin's friend and playmate. They live with Calvin's long-suffering parents, who have to cope with his turbulent behaviour. The charm of the strip is multi-faceted. On the one hand, Calvin is a typical six-year-old with a vivid imagination: one minute he is fearless intergalactic traveller Spaceman Spiff, crash-landing on a hostile planet, the next he is a fearsome T-Rex stalking his victim through the Jurassic jungle. He is in thrall to consumerism, hates school, loves making gruesome snowmen, and plays Calvinball, an anarchic game of ever-changing rules. Yet he is also given to philosophising about the big issues of life, ably supported or gently undermined by Hobbes's quietly caustic asides . Here is an outlet for Watterson's deeply-held views about the craziness of the modern world; indeed, the artist himself has always shunned publicity. The strip is also enhanced by its strong cast of supporting characters. Mrs Wormwood the teacher looms over Calvin when he not paying attention; the school bully is always on hand to 'pound' him; Susie, the little girl from down the road, often gets her own back on her snowball-throwing nemesis. Calvin's dad is a particularly funny creation: long-suffering, anti-media, and a proponent of fresh air, he also manages to get his revenge on his manic son by tying him up in mental knots with spurious bits of information . All these ingredients would, in the right hands, combine to make a perfectly good comic strip, but what always put Calvin and Hobbes ahead of the competition was the sheer artistry of Watterson's illustrations. In this regard, the chronological arrangement of the strips usefully shows Watterson's increasingly sophisticated technique, from his drawings of desert canyons and hideous inhabitants of alien planets, to the facial expressions of all his characters. It is hard to deny that Watterson owes a debt to Charles Schulz, whose Peanuts strip also offered a sophisticated yet deceptively simple evocation of the inner lives of children. For Calvin and Hobbes, however, Watterson combined uncanny ability, more than a touch of surrealism and a huge dose of humour to distil the essence of late-twentieth-century childhood, thereby elevating his strip into a league of its own.

On the eve of battle, Sir Thomas Lemuel Hawke of Cornwall writes a letter to his children. It is a guide on how to live well, like a knight: staying wise, humble, courageous, loving and kind.

Inside, an editorâs note talks about the discovery of the âhistoricalâ letter, confirming Sir Thomas's death at the Battle of Slaughter Bridge in 1483.It all gives the book an important and timeless feel.

So when an inexplicable glitch in his final examination ends his hopes at a single stroke, he has no choice but to take up the less-than-legal offer of captaining the Invictus through time and space. What he doesnât realise is that the glitch was planned. Someone is playing him â someone who is a lot closer to him than he could ever have imagined. What is at stake is more than his career, more than his mother, and even more than his life. Graudin weaves an exciting plot where time travel is just the beginning. Her characters are spunky, smart-mouthed, tormented, emotionally yearning and contemporary. Itâs Firefly meets Assassinâs Creed, but Graudin has a way with words that gives the book depth and makes it more than just an enjoyable page-turner.

This extraordinary graphic novel is so obviously a labour of love that the reader can only marvel at the energy that has been expended in its creation. Although the two plots that make up the book are essentially simple, the care with which Ware has executed them gives them an almost mythic quality. Jimmy Corrigan is a lonely, single, thirty-something with a boring job in an office cubicle, and a domineering mother who, in spite of living in a nursing home, is never far from the telephone or Jimmy. His crippling shyness renders him incapable of even saying hello to Peggy, the woman who works at an adjacent desk. When the father he has never known sends him an invitation and a plane ticket, Jimmy feels compelled to fly out to meet him. Jimmy's trip is mirrored by the boyhood tale of his grandfather, James, whose relationship with his father is tainted by unhappiness. Young James's mother has died, leaving his father with the unwanted job of bringing up the little boy alone, while at the same time maintaining his job as a glazier at the 1892 Chicago World's Fair. James is a frightened little boy, cowed by his father and bullied at school; he has a vagueness and fragility common to young, lonely and fearful children, qualities that are inherited generations later by his grandson. Chris Ware's illustrations are simply awe-inspiring in the true sense of the word. It is hard to believe that someone could put so much detail into each of the 380 pages that make up this incredible book, but there is a clue to his devotion in the afterword. After spending most of his life avoiding his own father, speaking only rarely on the phone, Ware finally met up with him: 'Gradually, the sublime outrageousness of our evening eroded into two people simply running out of things to say to each other. We weren't father and son anymore, just a pair of regretful men.'
